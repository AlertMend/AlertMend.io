## <span id="customer-overview" /> Customer Overview

**Company:** WareFlex  
**Company Size:** 21–50  
**Industry:** Logistics / Supply Chain Tech  
**Region:** Vietnam (HQ), expanding into North America  
**Kubernetes:** GKE

Founded in 2022, WareFlex offers a full-service logistics platform—connecting businesses to thousands of trucks and hundreds of warehouses across Vietnam while scaling into global markets. Using GKE, the engineering team manages containerized microservices for their WMS, OMS, and TMS systems. However, rapid growth brought increased infrastructure costs and complexity.

---

## <span id="challenge" /> Challenge

As WareFlex scaled, they faced key operational challenges:
- Over-provisioned containers and VMs reserved far more resources than they used, inflating costs  
- Accumulated unused PVCs eating into storage budgets  
- No centralized automation to identify inefficiencies  
- Rising GKE costs risked outpacing growth and profits  

They needed a seamless way to identify and reclaim waste—without disrupting services or managing infrastructure manually.

## <span id="solution-with-alertmend" /> Solution with AlertMend

WareFlex implemented **AlertMend’s Kubernetes Cost Optimization Engine** across its GKE clusters. It worked like this:

### Automated Resource Tuning
- Prometheus-driven analysis recommended right-sizing of pods and VMs  
- AlertMend applied changes safely without requiring manual YAML edits

### Storage Cleanup
- Identified unused or oversized PVCs  
- Safely decommissioned underutilized storage volumes

### Node Optimization
- Suggested more efficient machine types based on actual usage patterns

### Self-Serve Remediation
- Engineers applied optimizations with a click — no YAML required

### Continuous Cost Monitoring
- Ongoing alerts and dashboards ensured long-term resource efficiency
