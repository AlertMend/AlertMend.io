### <span id="use-cases" />Use Cases::

* Enabled fine-grained process supervision inside VMs.
* Ensured incidents were real before restarting.
* Restarted crashed or frozen AI services automatically.
* Recovered entire infrastructure when instances were unresponsive.
* Delivered transparency and ownership without requiring 24/7 ops.
*Allowed deployment in minutes on vanilla GCP VMs

## <span id="customer-overview" /> Customer Overview

**Company:** AIVOS  
**Company Size:** 1–10  
**Industry:** AI Voice Assistant / Conversational AI  
**Region:** Vietnam  
**Infrastructure:** Google Cloud VMs (no Kubernetes)

AIVOS is a Vietnam-based startup building AI-powered voice assistants that help businesses automate customer support and conversation workflows. Their early product runs entirely on Google Cloud VMs, hosting inference services, message queues, and real-time audio pipelines.

## <span id="challenge" /> Challenge

The AIVOS team faced growing pains as their service matured:
- Core AI services inside VMs would occasionally freeze, deadlock, or stop processing jobs — without crashing or failing health checks  
- GCP VM health appeared normal, masking issues at the application level  
- Manual restarts were required via SSH or GCP Console — often after users were already affected  
- No 24/7 monitoring, so incidents frequently went undetected overnight  
- Engineers lost hours each week reacting to the same issues repeatedly  

They needed a lightweight way to detect, act on, and escalate real issues inside VMs — **without migrating to Kubernetes** or introducing operational overhead.

## <span id="solution-with-alertmend" /> Solution with AlertMend

AIVOS deployed **AlertMend agents directly on their virtual machines**, integrating with their existing logging and process monitoring setup.

They built a **two-layered remediation strategy**:

### 1️⃣ <span id="service-level-monitoring&-recovery" /> Service-Level Monitoring & Recovery
- AlertMend monitored system logs and custom health scripts to detect if AI services (e.g., audio processors, NLP workers) had stalled  
- If the service was inactive beyond a threshold:  
  - AlertMend restarted the specific process or container  
  - Captured logs and status for audit  
  - Posted a summary to Slack for asynchronous review  

### 2️⃣<span id="vm-level-remediation" /> VM-Level Remediation
- If the VM itself was unresponsive (e.g., no SSH, no heartbeat):  
  - AlertMend triggered a GCP VM auto-restart  
  - Ensured boot-time service restoration scripts were triggered  
  - Escalated via Slack to a `#critical` channel with full incident context  

This setup allowed **fully automated recovery** for most incidents, while keeping humans in the loop for critical or unresolved issues.

## <span id="results" /> Results

- **90%+** of service failures were auto-remediated with no human involvement  
- **100%** recovery of previously “stuck” VMs via automatic restart  
- **Zero overnight alerts** for known failure types since deployment  
- **Fewer false positives**, thanks to log-based validation  
- **Saved several hours per week**, freeing engineers to focus on product improvements

## <span id="summary" /> Summary

With no Kubernetes and a tiny team, **AIVOS** turned to AlertMend to add automated incident response to their GCP VM-based stack. From restarting frozen services to auto-recovering entire VMs, **AlertMend** helped them operate like a much larger team — keeping systems stable and engineers focused on innovation.
