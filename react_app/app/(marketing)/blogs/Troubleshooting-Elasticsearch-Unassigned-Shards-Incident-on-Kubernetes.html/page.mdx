# 🚨 **Troubleshooting Elasticsearch Unassigned Shards Incident on Kubernetes**
---

**Elasticsearch unassigned shards** occur when a node is unable to assign shards properly, leading to reduced cluster performance and potential data loss. Shards are the building blocks of Elasticsearch indexes, and unassigned shards indicate that Elasticsearch cannot find a suitable node to hold shard replicas. In **Kubernetes** environments, this issue can arise due to insufficient resources, misconfiguration, or pod failures. In this blog, we’ll cover the causes, troubleshooting steps, and solutions to help you resolve unassigned shard issues efficiently, ensuring optimal cluster performance and data reliability.


## 🔍 **Common Causes of Unassigned Shards in Elasticsearch**

There are several reasons why shards may remain unassigned in Elasticsearch:
- **Insufficient Node Resources**: If the cluster nodes lack sufficient CPU, memory, or storage, Elasticsearch may fail to assign shards.
- **Node Failures**: When a node is marked as unavailable, shards from that node may remain unassigned until a new node is available.
- **Configuration Issues**: Misconfigured settings can prevent Elasticsearch from distributing shards correctly.
- **Pod Evictions**: In Kubernetes environments, pod evictions or disruptions can lead to unassigned shards.

---

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting Unassigned Shards in Elasticsearch**

### 1. **Check Elasticsearch Pods**
Ensure that all Elasticsearch pods are running as expected. If any pods are down, they may be causing the unassigned shards:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n ${ELASTICSEARCH_NAMESPACE} -l app=${ELASTICSEARCH_APP}
```

### 2. **Check Elasticsearch Service**
Verify that the Elasticsearch service is running and accessible:
```bash
kubectl get svc -n ${ELASTICSEARCH_NAMESPACE} ${ELASTICSEARCH_SERVICE}
```

### 3. **Check Elasticsearch Deployment**
Ensure that the Elasticsearch deployment is up and running. A misconfigured deployment could be responsible for unassigned shards:
```bash
kubectl get deployment -n ${ELASTICSEARCH_NAMESPACE} ${ELASTICSEARCH_DEPLOYMENT}
```

### 4. **Monitor Elasticsearch Node Health**
Use the following command to check if all Elasticsearch nodes are healthy:
```bash
kubectl exec -it ${ELASTICSEARCH_POD_NAME} -n ${ELASTICSEARCH_NAMESPACE} curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_cat/nodes?v'
```

### 5. **Check Shard Assignment**
To see whether the shards are being assigned, use the following command:
```bash
kubectl exec -it ${ELASTICSEARCH_POD_NAME} -n ${ELASTICSEARCH_NAMESPACE} curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_cat/shards?v'
```

### 6. **Check Kubernetes Node Resources**
Ensure that your Kubernetes nodes have enough resources to allocate to Elasticsearch:
```bash
kubectl get nodes --show-labels
```

### 7. **Check for Pod Evictions or Disruptions**
Pod evictions or disruptions may cause unassigned shards. Check for any such events in your cluster:
```bash
kubectl get events -n ${ELASTICSEARCH_NAMESPACE}
```

### 8. **Review Elasticsearch Logs**
Search the Elasticsearch logs for any errors related to unassigned shards:
```bash
kubectl logs -f ${ELASTICSEARCH_POD_NAME} -n ${ELASTICSEARCH_NAMESPACE} | grep "unassigned"
```

## 🛡️ **Fixing Elasticsearch Unassigned Shards**

### 1. **Ensure Adequate Resources for Elasticsearch Pods**
Verify that your Elasticsearch pods have enough CPU, memory, and storage space:
```bash
# Check CPU usage
CPU_USAGE=$(kubectl exec -n $NAMESPACE $POD_NAME -- sh -c "ps -p 1 -o %cpu | tail -1")
if (( $(echo "$CPU_USAGE > 80.0" | bc -l) )); then
  echo "WARNING: CPU usage of Elasticsearch pod is high: $CPU_USAGE%"
fi

# Check memory usage
MEMORY_USAGE=$(kubectl exec -n $NAMESPACE $POD_NAME -- sh -c "free -m | awk 'NR==2{printf "%s/%sMB (%.2f%%)", $3,$2,$3*100/$2 }'")
if (( $(echo "$MEMORY_USAGE" | awk -F'[(%)]' '{print $2}' | awk '{print int($1)}') > 80 )); then
  echo "WARNING: Memory usage of Elasticsearch pod is high: $MEMORY_USAGE"
fi

# Check storage space usage
STORAGE_USAGE=$(kubectl exec -n $NAMESPACE $POD_NAME -- sh -c "df -h /usr/share/elasticsearch/data | awk '{print $5}' | tail -1 | sed 's/%//g'")
if (( $STORAGE_USAGE > 80 )); then
  echo "WARNING: Storage space usage of Elasticsearch pod is high: $STORAGE_USAGE%"
fi
```

### 2. **Scale the Elasticsearch Deployment**
If the cluster is running out of resources, scale the Elasticsearch deployment to add more pods:
```bash
# Set the number of replicas to scale up
kubectl scale deployment -n $NAMESPACE $DEPLOYMENT_NAME --replicas=$REPLICAS
```

### 3. **Rebalance Shards**
In some cases, manual intervention may be needed to rebalance unassigned shards across the cluster:
```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/reroute?retry_failed=true'
```

|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Shards remain unassigned               | Insufficient resources on nodes                | Scale the deployment, add more resources          |
| Unresponsive nodes                     | Node failures or pod evictions                 | Restart failed nodes, ensure node availability    |
| Unbalanced shard allocation            | Misconfigured cluster settings                 | Rebalance shards, ensure correct configuration    |

## 🚀 **Conclusion**

Unassigned shards can significantly degrade the performance of an **Elasticsearch** cluster, leading to data loss and slow query responses. By following the troubleshooting steps outlined here and ensuring that your **Kubernetes** cluster has enough resources, you can resolve unassigned shard incidents quickly and maintain the stability and efficiency of your Elasticsearch deployment.
