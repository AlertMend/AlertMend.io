# üö® **Debugging Kubernetes OOMKilled (Exit Code 137): Causes and Solutions**
---

The **OOMKilled** error in Kubernetes occurs when a container is terminated due to excessive memory usage, which exceeds the predefined memory limit. This is represented by exit code 137. When this happens, Kubernetes uses the **Out of Memory (OOM) Killer**, a feature of the Linux kernel, to protect the system from crashing by terminating the container that consumes too much memory. In this blog, we‚Äôll explore common causes of the **OOMKilled** error and provide practical steps for troubleshooting and prevention.

## üõ†Ô∏è **What Is OOMKilled in Kubernetes?**

The **OOMKilled** status is triggered when the container exceeds its allocated memory limit, leading to termination. This memory management feature is crucial for maintaining system stability, as it prevents one container from consuming all available memory on the node. Each container within a pod can define two important memory-related parameters:
- **Memory Requests**: The minimum memory guaranteed for the container.
- **Memory Limits**: The maximum memory a container can use before being killed.

When memory usage surpasses the set limits, the Linux kernel sends a **SIGKILL** signal, killing the container to free up resources.

## üîç **Common Causes of OOMKilled Errors**

| **Cause**                          | **Description**                                           | **Solution**                                               |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Misconfigured Memory Limits        | Application needs more memory than allocated.              | Adjust memory limits based on actual usage.                 |
| Memory Leaks                       | Application continuously consumes memory due to a leak.    | Use profiling tools to detect and fix memory leaks.         |
| Node Resource Overcommitment       | Node resources are overbooked by multiple containers.       | Set realistic requests and limits, use VPA for autoscaling.  |

### 1. **Misconfigured Memory Limits**
One of the most frequent reasons for OOMKilled errors is that the **memory limit** is set too low for the application‚Äôs needs. If your application requires more memory than the specified limit, Kubernetes will kill the container to protect the node.

**Solution**:
- Review and adjust memory limits based on the application‚Äôs actual usage by setting appropriate values in your pod spec:
    ```yaml
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "512Mi"
      limits:
        memory: "1Gi"
    ```

### 2. **Memory Leaks in Applications**
Applications with memory leaks can gradually consume more memory over time, eventually leading to OOMKilled events. Memory leaks often occur when an application fails to release memory it no longer needs.

**Solution**:
- Use tools like **Heapster**, **Prometheus**, or built-in language profilers (e.g., JVM profilers for Java applications) to detect memory leaks and fix them in the application‚Äôs code.

### 3. **Node Resource Overcommitment**
Nodes can become overcommitted when the sum of the memory requests across multiple pods exceeds the node‚Äôs available memory. If several containers request memory at the same time, the node may run out of memory, causing Kubernetes to kill some pods.

**Solution**:
- Set realistic **memory requests** and **limits** for each container to avoid overcommitment. Use Kubernetes **Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)** to automatically adjust memory requests and limits based on real-time usage.

## üö® **Steps to Troubleshoot OOMKilled Errors**

### 1. **Inspect Pod Events**
Use `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` to check pod events and verify whether the pod was terminated due to an **OOMKilled** event. Look for the **Exit Code 137** in the output:
```bash
State:          Terminated
Reason:         OOMKilled
Exit Code:      137
```

### 2. **Monitor Memory Usage**
Use tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to monitor memory usage trends across your cluster. Set up alerts for memory spikes to detect potential memory leaks or inefficient resource usage before they result in OOMKilled events.

### 3. **Analyze Resource Configuration**
Review the pod‚Äôs **resource requests** and **limits** to ensure they are sufficient for the container‚Äôs workload. Adjust limits if necessary to prevent future OOMKilled events:
```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "256Mi"
  limits:
    memory: "512Mi"
```

### 4. **Debug with Ephemeral Containers**
If you need more detailed debugging, you can use Kubernetes‚Äô **ephemeral containers** to inspect the running state of a pod before it gets killed. This can help investigate the memory consumption just before termination.
```bash
kubectl debug -it <pod-name> --image=busybox --target=<container-name>
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **Preventing OOMKilled Errors**

### 1. **Right-Sizing Resources**
Use historical memory usage data to set appropriate memory requests and limits for each container. This ensures that pods have enough memory while preventing overprovisioning.

### 2. **Enable Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)**
**VPA** dynamically adjusts pod resources based on actual usage patterns, preventing OOMKilled events by automatically increasing memory limits during high usage periods.

### 3. **Use Memory-Efficient Libraries**
Optimize your application to use libraries and algorithms that consume less memory. Regularly update your application to fix known memory inefficiencies.

## üöÄ **Conclusion**

**OOMKilled** errors in Kubernetes are often caused by misconfigured memory limits, memory leaks, or overcommitted nodes. By monitoring resource usage, setting appropriate memory requests and limits, and using tools like Vertical Pod Autoscaler, you can prevent these errors and keep your Kubernetes cluster running smoothly. Debugging tools like ephemeral containers and memory profiling tools can also help resolve persistent OOMKilled events.
