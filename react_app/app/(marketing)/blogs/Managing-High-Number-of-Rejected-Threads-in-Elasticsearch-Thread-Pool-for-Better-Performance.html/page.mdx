# üöÄ **Managing High Number of Rejected Threads in Elasticsearch Thread Pool for Better Performance**
---

In **Elasticsearch**, the thread pool manages concurrent threads needed for various operations like indexing and searching. However, a high number of rejected threads can indicate an overwhelmed thread pool that is unable to keep up with the current workload. Rejected threads lead to performance bottlenecks, slowdowns, and can impact overall system availability. This blog provides insights into identifying, diagnosing, and resolving high rejection rates in Elasticsearch‚Äôs thread pool.

## üîç **Common Causes of High Rejected Threads in Elasticsearch**

High rejected threads often result from:
- **Insufficient Thread Pool Size**: Limited thread pool size cannot handle the concurrent load. For instance, during peak usage or bulk indexing events, the thread pool may reach its capacity quickly.
- **Resource Constraints**: Low CPU or memory availability affects thread execution, causing tasks to be rejected when resources are insufficient.
- **High Request Volume**: A sudden spike in requests or tasks, such as increased search queries or indexing, can overload the thread pool, leading to rejections.
- **Configuration Limits**: Low limits on threads per process or insufficient queue sizes can lead to frequent rejections, especially when workload demands are high.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Steps to Diagnose and Debug Rejected Threads in Elasticsearch**

### 1. **Check Current Thread Pool Rejection Count**
Use the command below to monitor rejection counts in the thread pool:
```bash
curl -XGET '${ELASTICSEARCH_HOST}:${ELASTICSEARCH_PORT}/_cat/thread_pool?v&h=name,rejected'
```
Monitoring this regularly, especially during peak times, can help identify patterns and spikes in rejections.

### 2. **Review Thread Pool Size and Queue Capacity**
Thread pool stats give insights into the current size, queue length, and rejection patterns:
```bash
curl -XGET '${ELASTICSEARCH_HOST}:${ELASTICSEARCH_PORT}/_nodes/stats/thread_pool?pretty'
```
Compare these values across nodes to identify if specific nodes are experiencing more pressure than others.

### 3. **Inspect Elasticsearch Logs for Errors**
Look for specific errors related to rejected thread executions in logs:
```bash
grep 'rejected execution' ${ELASTICSEARCH_LOG_FILE_PATH}
```
This can help understand the context in which threads are being rejected and identify the root cause.

### 4. **Evaluate System‚Äôs Thread and Process Limits**
Check the system‚Äôs max threads and per-process thread limits, which can affect Elasticsearch performance:
```bash
# Maximum threads in the system
cat /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max

# Maximum threads per process
ulimit -u
```
Low system limits can be a bottleneck and might need adjustment to support Elasticsearch‚Äôs workload.

## üõ°Ô∏è **Solutions for Managing High Rejected Threads in Elasticsearch**

To reduce thread rejection rates, optimizing thread pool size and configuring system resources are effective steps.

### 1. **Increase Thread Pool Size in Elasticsearch**

To handle more concurrent threads, increase the thread pool size. Use the script below to update Elasticsearch‚Äôs configuration:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the new thread pool size and config path
NEW_THREAD_POOL_SIZE=${NEW_THREAD_POOL_SIZE}
ELASTICSEARCH_CONFIG_FILE=${ELASTICSEARCH_CONFIG_FILE_PATH}

# Update thread pool size in configuration
sed -i "s/thread_pool.size: .*/thread_pool.size: $NEW_THREAD_POOL_SIZE/g" $ELASTICSEARCH_CONFIG_FILE

# Restart Elasticsearch for changes to apply
systemctl restart elasticsearch
```
Increasing the thread pool size can lead to higher memory consumption, so it's essential to monitor system performance after making changes.

### 2. **Optimize System Resources**
Ensure the system has adequate CPU and memory to prevent bottlenecks during high workload periods. Upgrading hardware or optimizing resource allocation can significantly reduce rejected threads.

### 3. **Scale Cluster Nodes**
Increase the number of nodes to distribute the workload and reduce the burden on individual thread pools. This helps ensure the cluster can handle larger volumes of requests without overloading.

### 4. **Optimize Request Complexity**
Reduce the complexity and frequency of search and indexing requests. Avoid wildcard searches and reduce aggregation complexity to lower memory and thread utilization. Throttling the rate of bulk indexing can also help prevent overwhelming the thread pool.

## üîÑ **Common Issues and Resolutions for High Rejected Threads**

| **Issue**                | **Cause**                           | **Solution**                                   |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| High thread rejections   | Insufficient thread pool capacity   | Increase thread pool size, scale nodes, avoid heavy concurrent operations |
| High CPU or memory usage | Resource exhaustion                | Optimize resource allocation, upgrade hardware  |
| Persistent rejection     | Inadequate per-process thread limit | Adjust thread limit or upgrade hardware        |

## üöÄ **Conclusion**

Managing high rejection rates in the Elasticsearch thread pool is critical for maintaining system efficiency and responsiveness. By scaling thread pool capacity, optimizing configuration limits, and ensuring adequate resources, Elasticsearch can handle high loads more effectively. Proactive tuning and monitoring can help in preventing issues before they impact overall performance.
