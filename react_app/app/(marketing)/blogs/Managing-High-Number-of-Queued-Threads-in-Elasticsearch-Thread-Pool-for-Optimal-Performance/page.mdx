  description:
    "In Elasticsearch, an excessive number of queued threads in the thread pool can be an indication that the workload is overwhelming the system, causing delays in request processing and performance degradation. The thread pool is responsible for handling concurrent tasks such as indexing and searching. When threads exceed the pool‚Äôs capacity, tasks queue up, slowing down operations. This blog outlines how to identify, debug, and resolve high thread queuing issues in Elasticsearch.",

## Common Causes of High Queued Threads in Elasticsearch

## üîç **Common Causes of High Queued Threads in Elasticsearch**

High queued threads often result from::
- **High Workload Demand:**: Sudden spikes in indexing or search requests, such as during peak usage hours or large data ingestion events..
- **Insufficient Thread Pool Size**: A small thread pool limits task processing capabilities, especially during intensive workloads.
- **Configuration Limits**: Low thread pool or queue size settings can lead to queuing, especially if they are not adjusted to match the workload requirements.
- **Cluster Resource Constraints**: Limited CPU or memory can slow thread processing, causing tasks to build up in the queue.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Steps to Diagnose and Debug Queued Threads in Elasticsearch**

### 1. **Check Current Queued Threads**
Monitor queued threads in the Elasticsearch search thread pool:
```bash
curl -s -XGET 'http://${ELASTICSEARCH_HOST}:9200/_cat/thread_pool?v' | grep -E '^search' | awk '{print $5}'
```
It is helpful to monitor this regularly, especially during peak times, to identify trends in queuing.

### 2. **Review Available Thread Count**
Checking available threads can reveal if the pool size is insufficient:
```bash
curl -s -XGET 'http://${ELASTICSEARCH_HOST}:9200/_cat/thread_pool?v' | grep -E '^search' | awk '{print $4}'
```
Compare these values across nodes to determine if certain nodes are under more pressure than others.

### 3. **Check Active Threads**
Evaluate the active threads to gauge current workload:
```bash
curl -s -XGET 'http://${ELASTICSEARCH_HOST}:9200/_cat/thread_pool?v' | grep -E '^search' | awk '{print $3}'
```

### 4. **Inspect Rejected and Completed Requests**
Rejected requests indicate overburdened resources. Review rejected and completed request counts:
```bash
# Rejected requests
curl -s -XGET 'http://${ELASTICSEARCH_HOST}:9200/_cat/thread_pool?v' | grep -E '^search' | awk '{print $6}'

# Completed requests
curl -s -XGET 'http://${ELASTICSEARCH_HOST}:9200/_cat/thread_pool?v' | grep -E '^search' | awk '{print $7}'
```
To mitigate rejected requests, consider implementing retry logic or load balancing across more nodes.

## üõ°Ô∏è **Solutions for Managing High Queued Threads in Elasticsearch**

To reduce queued threads, increasing thread pool size, optimizing requests, and allocating resources can be effective.

### 1. **Increase Thread Pool Size**

If the current pool is insufficient, increase the number of threads to manage requests better. Use the script below to adjust settings:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set the desired thread count and Elasticsearch config path
NEW_THREAD_COUNT=${DESIRED_THREAD_COUNT}
ELASTICSEARCH_CONFIG=${ELASTICSEARCH_CONFIG_PATH}
THREAD_POOL_NAME=${THREAD_POOL_NAME}

# Update thread pool settings in Elasticsearch configuration
sed -i "s/"$THREAD_POOL_NAME" : {""$THREAD_POOL_NAME" : {
    "size" : $NEW_THREAD_COUNT,/g" $ELASTICSEARCH_CONFIG

# Restart Elasticsearch for changes to apply
systemctl restart elasticsearch
```
Increasing thread pool size can increase memory usage, so monitor resource availability and adjust accordingly.

### 2. **Optimize Workloads**
Reduce search and indexing task complexity or frequency to relieve the thread pool. For example, limit the number of concurrent searches or adjust indexing batch sizes to lower memory and thread utilization.

### 3. **Scale Cluster Resources**
Add nodes or increase CPU and memory resources to distribute workloads efficiently. Scaling helps ensure each node can handle its share of tasks without overwhelming the thread pool.

## üöÄ **Conclusion**

Maintaining optimal thread pool performance in Elasticsearch is crucial for efficient data handling and search operations. By scaling the thread pool size, balancing workloads, and monitoring queued tasks, you can improve response times and ensure smooth operation of your Elasticsearch environment. Ongoing monitoring and adjustment of thread pool configurations are essential to keep up with changing workloads and ensure optimal performance.
