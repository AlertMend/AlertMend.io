    "excerpt": "Elasticsearch relies on efficient index flushing to write data to disk, but when index flushing slows down, it can lead to degraded performance, delayed queries, and system bottlenecks. Slow index flushing can occur due to several factors, including hardware limitations, network latency, memory exhaustion, or configuration issues. In this blog, we will dive into the common causes of slow index flushing, steps to troubleshoot the problem, and solutions to improve Elasticsearch performance.",

    "excerpt": "In Elasticsearch, the thread pool manages concurrent threads needed for various operations like indexing and searching. However, a high number of rejected threads can indicate an overwhelmed thread pool that is unable to keep up with the current workload. Rejected threads lead to performance bottlenecks, slowdowns, and can impact overall system availability. This blog provides insights into identifying, diagnosing, and resolving high rejection rates in Elasticsearch’s thread pool.",
