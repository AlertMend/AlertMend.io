Automate IT Operations with System Center - Orchestrator Runbooks Feedback Summarize this article for me The power of System Center - Orchestrator lies in providing runbooks and the individual activities that create up a runbook. Runbooks contain the instructions for an automated task or process.
The individual steps throughout a runbook are called activities. Within the runbook, additional controls provide information and instructions to control the sequence of activities in the runbook. Runbooks, activities, and each runbook control have configurable properties. You modify these properties to configure the behavior that your runbook requires. Starting Point Your runbook must have only one starting point. A starting point is an activity that automatically runs when the runbook is started.
Each activity in the runbook runs after the previous activity in the workflow is completed. If a runbook starts with any activity other than a monitor activity, the runbook begins processing, and attempts to run to completion. If the runbook starts with a monitoring activity, the monitor loads and waits for the trigger condition. When the condition is met, a runbook instance is created to run the remaining activities in the runbook. The monitor continues to run and waits for another occurrence of the trigger condition.
Runbooks that begin with monitors continue to run until you cease them from the Runbook Designer or Orchestration console. Variables When building runbooks, some settings are the same across activities. Variables let you specify a value that activities utilize in any runbook. crucial The access permissions for variables may be modified, but the runbook server doesn't enforce these permissions. crucial Be aware that in Orchestrator, variables that reference system variables, for example %ProgramFiles% , return values from a 32-bit runtime environment.
This is because Orchestrator represents 32-bit application. Note Orchestrator doesn't support moving multiple variables with multiple selection. To move more than one variable to another folder, you must move each variable individually. utilize the following procedures to create, insert, and organize variables. Create a variable Insert a variable in an activity Organize variables Follow these steps to create a variable: In the Connections pane in the Runbook Designer, expand the Global Settings folder, and then select the Variables folder.
Right-click the Variables folder or a subfolder of the Variables folder to select New , and then select Variable to open the New Variable dialog. In the Name box, enter a name for the variable. In the Description box, enter a description that explains the purpose of the variable. In the Value box, enter the value of the variable. This value replaces the placeholder in those activities where the variable is inserted. If you desire the variable to be encrypted (for example, to store a password for utilize in other runbook activities), select the Encrypted Variable checkbox.
For more information about best practices for using encrypted variables, observe Orchestrator Data Encryption. crucial Orchestrator doesn't let you combine an encrypted variable with plain text as a parameter value in a runbook. Follow these steps to insert a variable in an activity: Right-click the applicable activity from your runbook to select Properties , and then select the Details tab to open the activities properties dialog. In a text box, to open a menu, right-click to select Subscribe , and then select Variable to open the Select a Variable dialog.
Select the variable name, and then select OK. A placeholder {variable} is inserted next to the computer name in the Computer box. When the activity runs, the placeholder is replaced with the value of the variable. Follow these steps to organize variables: You can group variables into folders to organize them. To create a folder, right-click the Variables folder to select New , and then select Folder. To move a variable to a different folder, right-click the variable, and then select Move to open the Select a Folder dialog.
Select the destination folder, and then select OK. The variable is moved to the new folder location. Special Variables You can specify special formats of variables to provide dynamic information to your runbooks. Specify the value of the variable to invoke this behavior. NOW() : When the variable is resolved, it's set to the current date and time. You can pass arguments to this function to return specific portions of the date or time. For example, NOW(hour) returns the current hour.
The following are the valid arguments for the NOW() function: day, dayofweek, dayofyear, month, year, hour, minute, second, millisecond. %ENVVAR% : This variable returns the value of the environment variable between the percent (\) symbols. The environment variable is based on the runbook server computer where the runbook is running, and it's not case-sensitive.
All system variables may be resolved. Any user variables are resolved in the context of the service account on the runbook server. If the environment variable doesn't exist, the text specified within the variable is returned as-is (that is, if you enter %ENVVAR% and no environment variable named ENVVAR exists, the text '%ENVVAR%' is returned). Workflow Control When you build runbooks in Orchestrator, it's crucial to comprehend the underlying logic of the workflow engine.
By using this logic, you can create workflows to automate resource-based jobs and complex data processing tasks. The workflow control provides the following controls: Smart Links and Embedded Loops. Smart Links The links that connect individual activities in a runbook are called smart links. Smart links in Orchestrator support precedence between two activities. Smart links invoke the next activity in the runbook as soon as the previous activity finishes successfully.
Smart links also provide filtering capabilities for the data so that you can limit the data passed to subsequent activities in the workflow. Embedded Loops Each activity can create a loop so that you can retry operations if they fail or test the output information of the activity for valid data. You can also utilize these mechanisms to build wait conditions into your workflows. When a loop is configured for an activity, it continues to run with the same input data until a desired exit looping criteria is reached.
The exit criteria are built in a similar way as smart link configurations. You can utilize any published data item from the activity as part of the exit or don't exit configuration. Included in the common published data are special data items, such as Loop: Number of attempts and Loop: Total duration , that let you utilize information from the loop itself in the looping conditions. Loops run one time for each incoming piece of data that is passed to the activity.
For example, consider a runbook that uses a Query Database activity followed by Append Line. If the Query Database activity returned three rows, the Append Line activity would run three times. If you have a loop on the Append Line activity, it would run three separate loops. After the first data item has looped through the Append Line activity, the next item goes through Append Line and loops until it exits, and then the third begins. After all the three items were processed, the next activity in the runbook runs.
Extend Runbook capabilities Orchestrator provides two options for extending standard activities. You can either build new activities or create new Integration Packs (IP). IPs are collections of activities for Microsoft and products of other companies, which are specific to a product or technology. If the functionality that you require isn't available in an IP, you have the alternative option of using the Orchestrator Integration Toolkit. The Orchestrator Integration Toolkit represents set of tools to assist you create new integrations for Orchestrator.
You can utilize wizards in the Integration Toolkit to easily create new workflow activities and Integration Packs that extend the capabilities of the product. You can also create custom workflow activities using the Orchestrator SDK and C#, and then package them into an IP using this toolkit. Next steps obtain detailed information about the Integration Toolkit. Learn more about how to design and build runbooks. Feedback Was this page helpful? Yes No No require assist with this topic?

System Center 2012 Orchestrator – RunBook Basics Feedback Summarize this article for me System Center Orchestrator 2012 which represents new member of System Center 2012 family and next version of Opalis, takes place at the center of Private Cloud scenarios.
During automation of your dynamic datacenters, Orchestrator can move your operations one more step forward and can integrate with Microsoft and non-Microsoft solutions with just a few clicks. Let me give you a few examples; You can trigger Orchestrator workflows through an incident management system such as Service Manager 2012. Periodic installation processes may be automated. For example during installation, you can take actions on active directory, cease load balancer pools, check service status etc.
Active directory operational tasks such as user create, user delete, group create, change memberships etc. may be moved to the orchestrator RunBooks. You can monitor SCOM alerts and trigger custom RunBooks. For example, when a virtual machine run out of disk, SCOM generates an alert and orchestrator can assign additional disk through triggered RunBook.
In this blog post series we’ll cover of how to design RunBooks from basic to complex. And at end of the series you will comprehend what Orchestrator 2012 can do and how can you integrate it into your current environment. For the first part “RunBook Basics” I’ll mention basic RunBooks concept and activities that resides within RunBooks. A RunBook consists of automated tasks and process steps. Also, each automated step within RunBooks is called activities.
Here is the highly basic RunBook design; http://blogs. ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-79-57-metablogapi/2744. clip_5F00_image0014_5F00_thumb_5F00_2B576168. png That RunBook reads a static text file and maps each line to the server names then restarts a service for each remote server automatically. Before going into the RunBook creation details, let’s look at the RunBook properties. ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-79-57-metablogapi/8662.
clip_5F00_image0024_5F00_thumb_5F00_08734D60. png Right click a previously created RunBook and click Properties. GENERAL: http://blogs. ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-79-57-metablogapi/4540. clip_5F00_image0034_5F00_thumb_5F00_4EE0179B. png On the General tab, you can customize name and description fields. Name is an crucial field because if you decide to import your RunBooks into the Service Manager as activities, you will recognize each RunBook with its name.
(Yes you can import your RunBooks into the Service Manager!) Also on general tab, you can set a schedule to allow RunBook runs only on dates and times you specify. RUNBOOK SERVERS: http://blogs. ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-79-57-metablogapi/5076. clip_5F00_image0044_5F00_thumb_5F00_285DE8B6. png Each RunBook needs a RunBook server to run. In case of requirement High Availability , you must add additional RunBook Servers.
For each RunBook, primary and standby RunBook Servers may be set. Failure of primary RunBook server will trigger standby RunBook server to act as primary. ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-79-57-metablogapi/4062. clip_5F00_image0054_5F00_thumb_5F00_1936E40F. png To set Primary and Standby RunBook Server for RunBooks, click Add and specify your RunBook servers. LOGGING: In this section, you can choose more logging options to store in Orchestrator Database and demonstrate up within Orchestrator Console.
I’ll talk about in more details in future posts. ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-79-57-metablogapi/2475. clip_5F00_image0064_5F00_thumb_5F00_56D3A5FE. png EVENT NOTIFICATION http://blogs. ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-79-57-metablogapi/6758. clip_5F00_image0074_5F00_thumb_5F00_5144E9C0. png On event notification tab, additional log file may be generated when a RunBook fails to run or run for more than specified seconds.
Related log files may be viewed with Designer Console or Web Console. JOB CONCURRENCY http://blogs. ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-79-57-metablogapi/3617. clip_5F00_image0085_5F00_thumb_5F00_3F6441F4. png One of the most critical option is Job Concurrency. Even you configure this setting for one single RunBook, in fact it has impact on overall Orchestrator RunBook Servers. Main purpose is specifying concurrent jobs for this RunBook.
A RunBook server can have maximum 50 concurrent jobs. So that if you require more than this limit you must deploy additional RunBook servers. RETURNED DATA http://blogs. ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-79-57-metablogapi/4265. clip_5F00_image0094_5F00_thumb_5F00_49A54087. png If you finalize your activities with “Return Data” activity, this RunBook can carry out defined data to the other RunBooks. ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-79-57-metablogapi/2337.
clip_5F00_image0104_5F00_thumb_5F00_2A9E5B42. png In this blog post we cover basic RunBook concept. For the next parts we’ll drive in more detail about designing and deploying RunBooks over multiple RunBook servers. com/7746537/0/ff1d3be5/1/ Additional resources Last updated on 2024-01-17
