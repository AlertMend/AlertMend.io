## Understanding
: Fundamentals for Effective Management
### Essential Components of Kubernetes
To effectively manage Kubernetes production incidents, it is imperative to grasp the fundamental components that make up the ecosystem.
Key elements include:

- **Pods**: The smallest deployable units, consisting of one or more containers.

## Understanding
- **CNI (Container Network Interface)**: Essential for configuring network interfaces in Linux containers, ensuring smooth communication between pods.
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Implements stringent access control measures, which are critical in preventing unauthorized access and ensuring compliance. - **Ingress**: Manages external access to services within the cluster, typically HTTP, and is vital for controlling traffic flow.
