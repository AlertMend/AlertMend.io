Overrides the default *core/account* property value for this command invocation --billing-project <BILLING_PROJECT> The Google Cloud Platform project that shall be charged quota for operations performed in gcloud. If you require to operate on one project, but require quota against a different project, you can utilize this flag to specify the billing project. If both `billing/quota_project` and `--billing-project` are specified, `--billing-project` takes precedence. Run `$ gcloud config set --assist` to observe more information about `billing/quota_project` --configuration <CONFIGURATION> The configuration to utilize for this command invocation. For more information on how to utilize configurations, run: `gcloud topic configurations`. You can also utilize the CLOUDSDK_ACTIVE_CONFIG_NAME environment variable to set the equivalent of this flag for a terminal session --filter <EXPRESSION> Apply a Boolean filter _EXPRESSION_ to each resource item to be listed. If the expression evaluates `True`, then that item is listed. For more details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters. This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order: *--flatten*, *--sort-by*, *--filter*, *--limit* --flags-file <YAML_FILE> A YAML or JSON file that specifies a *--flag*:*value* dictionary. Useful for specifying complex flag values with special characters that work with any command interpreter. Additionally, each *--flags-file* arg is replaced by its constituent flags. observe $ gcloud topic flags-file for more information --flatten <KEY> Flatten _name_[] output resource slices in _KEY_ into separate records for each item in each slice. Multiple keys and slices may be specified. This also flattens keys for *--format* and *--filter*. For example, *--flatten=abc. ghi* references to *abc. A resource record containing *abc. def[]* with N elements will expand to N records in the flattened output. This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order: *--flatten*, *--sort-by*, *--filter*, *--limit* --format <FORMAT> Set the format for printing command output resources. The default represents command-specific human-friendly output format. The supported formats are: `config`, `csv`, `default`, `diff`, `disable`, `flattened`, `obtain`, `json`, `list`, `multi`, `none`, `object`, `table`, `text`, `value`, `yaml`. For more details run $ gcloud topic formats --assist Display detailed assist --impersonate-service-account <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL> For this gcloud invocation, all API requests shall be made as the given service account instead of the currently selected account. This is done without needing to create, download, and activate a key for the account. In order to perform operations as the service account, your currently selected account must have an IAM role that includes the iam. getAccessToken permission for the service account. serviceAccountTokenCreator role has this permission or you may create a custom role. Overrides the default *auth/impersonate_service_account* property value for this command invocation --limit <LIMIT> Maximum number of resources to list. The default is *unlimited*.

Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) Last Updated : 24 Oct, 2025 Comments Improve Suggest changes 1 Likes Like Report Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) represents fully managed service that enables users to run Docker-based applications in containers across a cluster of EC2 instances. ECS simplifies container orchestration, allowing you to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications efficiently. The service supports multiple launch types, including the AWS Fargate launch type, which abstracts the underlying EC2 infrastructure, enabling you to run containers without needing to manage or provision the EC2 instances. This allows developers to focus on building and deploying applications while AWS handles the cluster management and resource provisioning. The Core Components To comprehend ECS, you must first comprehend its four fundamental building blocks. Task Definition A Task Definition is the blueprint for your application. It's a JSON file that describes how to run a Docker container. It specifies crucial parameters like: The Docker image to utilize (e. , nginx:latest from Docker Hub or your own image in Amazon ECR). The CPU and memory to allocate to the container. The ports to open on the container. Environment variables, logging configurations, and the IAM Role the task will utilize. Task A Task represents single, running instance of a Task Definition. If the Task Definition is the blueprint, the Task is the actual house built from that blueprint. Service While you can run individual Tasks, for any long-running application, you'll utilize a Service. The ECS Service is responsible for maintaining a specified number of Tasks running continuously. Its key responsibilities include: Maintaining the "Desired Count": If a Task fails or stops for any reason, the Service scheduler will automatically launch a new one to replace it, ensuring your application is self-healing. Load Balancing: It can integrate with an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic evenly across all the Tasks in the Service. Auto Scaling: It can automatically increase or decrease the number of Tasks based on metrics like CPU usage or the number of requests. Cluster A Cluster represents logical grouping of resources where your Tasks are run. It's the underlying infrastructure that provides the CPU, memory, and networking for your containers. How Elastic Container Service Works? Amazon elastic container service represents fully managed service which is provided by AWS it is mainly used to deploy containers that are docker based by which you scale up and down depending on the traffic you're going to obtain. The containers will run inside the Amazon elastic cloud (EC2) instance. Container: A container represents package that holds an application and everything dependencies, libraries, etc. ) the application requires to run. Containers are independent of the underlying operating system and hence container applications are fairly portable, flexible, and scalable. This ensures the application will run always as expected irrespective of the system and environment in which a container is run. Docker: Docker is software that facilitates and automates the installation and deployment of applications inside Linux containers. Cluster: A logic group of EC2 instances running as a single application. Container Instance: Each EC2 in an ECS Cluster is called a container instance. The Most crucial Choice: Fargate vs. EC2 Launch Types When you run a task, you must decide where it will run. ECS offers two powerful options, known as "launch types. AWS Fargate (Serverless) What it is: Fargate represents serverless compute engine for containers. You simply define your application in a Task Definition, and Fargate launches and manages the containers for you without you ever having to think about the underlying servers. How it works: You pay for the CPU and memory resources your application requests, billed per second. Best for: The vast majority of modern applications. It's perfect for microservices, web applications, and batch jobs where you desire to focus on your code, not on managing infrastructure. It provides the fastest path to running containers on AWS. EC2 Launch Type What it is: With the EC2 launch type, you are responsible for managing the cluster of EC2 instances that your containers will run on. You add these EC2 instances to your ECS Cluster, and the ECS agent on each instance registers it with the control plane. How it works: The ECS scheduler places your Tasks onto the EC2 instances in your cluster. You have full control over the type of EC2 instance, the operating system, and any custom configurations. Best for: Applications with specific compliance requirements, those needing more control over the host environment, or for workloads that require GPUs or other specialized hardware not available on Fargate. Amazon ECS Terminologies and Components Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) represents managed service for deploying, managing and scaling containers. Here’s a quick look at its key components: 1. Provisioning Provisioning tools assist set up and manage ECS resources: AWS CLI: Command-line interface for direct control. Copilot: Simplifies ECS workflows. Management Console: Graphical interface for ECS management. AWS CDK & SDK: Enables infrastructure as code and custom integrations. Controller The ECS Scheduler manages and distributes tasks, balancing workloads and ensuring availability across clusters. Capacity Options Amazon ECS supports different capacity options: Amazon EC2 Instances: Customizable virtual machine hosting. Fargate: Serverless container hosting without infrastructure management. On-Premises Compute: Extends ECS to on-premises servers for hybrid solutions. This structure offers flexibility and control for containerized applications in AWS and beyond. How ECS Auto Scaling Works ECS provides powerful auto-scaling capabilities at two levels: Task-level Scaling (Service Auto Scaling): This is the most common type. You can configure your ECS Service to automatically add or remove Tasks based on demand. For example, you can set a rule like: "If the average CPU utilization of all my tasks goes above 75%, add two more tasks. " This is perfect for handling traffic spikes. Infrastructure-level Scaling (Cluster Auto Scaling): This applies only to the EC2 launch type. Cluster Auto Scaling automatically adds or removes EC2 instances from your cluster based on the resources required by your tasks. This ensures you are only paying for the EC2 instances you actually require. Common utilize Cases for ECS Microservices Architecture: ECS represents natural fit for breaking down a monolithic application into smaller, independently deployable microservices. Each service may be managed by its own ECS Service, with its own scaling rules and deployment pipeline. Web Applications: Run scalable, highly available web applications by placing an Application Load Balancer in front of an ECS Service. Batch Processing: Run short-lived, data-intensive jobs for tasks like financial modeling, scientific simulations, or ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes. You can schedule these as individual Tasks. CI/CD Pipelines: utilize ECS to run your build, test, and deployment jobs as containerized tasks, creating a consistent and repeatable pipeline. Advantages of ECS Here are some advantages of ECS: Scalability: ECS automatically scales your applications based on demand, allowing you to easily handle changes in traffic or workload. High availability: ECS provides built-in availability and fault tolerance, ensuring that your applications are always up and running. Cost-effective: ECS enables you to optimize your infrastructure costs by scaling resources based on demand and only paying for what you utilize. Integration: ECS integrates with other AWS services such as Amazon ECR, AWS Fargate, Amazon CloudWatch, and AWS IAM. Security: ECS provides a secure environment to run your applications, with features such as IAM roles for tasks, VPC isolation, and encryption at rest. ECS has some limitations to consider. For example, it requires a certain level of expertise to set up and configure the service. Additionally, it may not be suitable for applications that require a high level of customization or specialized networking requirements. Ways to Provision and Manage ECS You can interact with ECS using a variety of tools, catering to different workflows: AWS Management Console: A graphical web interface, perfect for getting started and for visual monitoring. AWS Copilot CLI: A modern, developer-friendly command-line tool designed to create it extremely easy to build, release, and operate containerized applications on ECS. AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit): Define your ECS infrastructure as code using familiar programming languages like Python, TypeScript, or Go. AWS CLI: The standard command-line interface for direct, low-level control over all ECS resources. AWS Command Line Interface(AWS CLI) AWS provides a set of commands that may be run on AWS-CLI (AWS Command Line Interface) to manage your services. Much like you'd manage from your AWS Console. Following represents list of commands that may be used for managing the AWS ECS service. create-capacity-provider: Used to create a new capacity provider. Capacity providers comprise a name, an Auto Scaling group along with termination and scaling settings. create-cluster: Creates a new AWS ECS Cluster. create-service: Runs and maintains a desired number of tasks as specified by the given task definition. create-task-set: Create a the task-set in AWS ECS cluster or a Service. delete-account-setting: Disables an account setting for an IAM user, role, the or the root user of the account. delete-attributes: Deletes one or more custom attributeof thehe a ECS cluster. delete-cluster: Deletes an entire specified cluster. delete-service: Deletes the specified service. delete-task-set: Deletes the specified task-set. deploy: Deploys new task definition to the specified ECS service. deregister-container-instance: Deregisters the specified container instance from its ECS cluster. deregister-task-definition: Deregistersa task definition from ECS Service. describe-capacity-providers: Describes one or more capacity providers. describe-clusters: Describes one or more of ECS Clusters. describe-container-instances: Describes ECS container instances.

Today, we're announcing that we are adding a new managed container service to our list of cloud services. Today, we're announcing that we are adding a new managed container service to our list of cloud services. The container service is now available to users as a complimentary service offered on our public, private, and hybrid cloud infrastructure. The container service is compatible with multiple container platforms -- and we're excited to announce that the first container platform to be supported is Kubernetes. The new managed service will allow users to quickly deploy Kubernetes container clusters with automated scripts. As of today, users can create up a cluster and begin using it in a matter of minutes. Why Kubernetes? Kubernetes is currently one of the world's leading container orchestration framework. Kubernetes owes its success to being initially built by Google who has decades of experience managing containerized applications on a highly large scale. Kubernetes is now run by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNSF) is an open source project with a large active community. This ensures that the project is constantly being updated with new features that further simplify the deployment, scaling, and high availability of containerized applications. Why Kubernetes On VEXXHOST Infrastructure? Public, private & hybrid offering: VEXXHOST's infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) offers public , private and hybrid cloud deployments. All our cloud services are offered on all three hosting models and Kubernetes container services are no different. Users will have access to our managed Kubernetes-as-a-Service offering across all our deployment platforms. OpenStack & Kubernetes: As avid OpenStack users, contributors, and sponsors, we've ensured that our Kubernetes Service would work along with all our OpenStack services. The container service, which is powered by the OpenStack project Magnum, gives users the freedom of choosing between OpenStack and Kubernetes. In many cases, users might desire to work with both OpenStack and Kubernetes to benefit from their respective advantages. In which case, they shall be able to utilize both solutions in the same environment. Open Source and No Vendor Lock-In We pride ourselves on the fact that all our infrastructure solutions are open sourced and have no vendor lock-in. Users can easily migrate their container workloads to anywhere Kubernetes is supported. By using open source solutions, users have the flexibility of taking over their Kubernetes cluster at any time. Knowing exactly what is happening 'under the hood' allows them to easily modify and configure the cluster if needed. Pricing Kubernetes container service is available to all users for free. Users can benefit from the fully managed service for free while only paying for the resource instances they require to create the container cluster. Instances are billed on an hourly basis with no long-term commitments. Here's a quick guide to demonstrate how simple it is to create a Kubernetes cluster and access Kubernetes UI dashboard. Create cluster To create a Kubernetes cluster, run the following command. $ magnum cluster-create --name my-cluster --cluster-template my-template --node-count 1 --master-count 1 Replace “ my-cluster ” with the name of your cluster. Replace “ my-template ” by the cluster template name. You can utilize “ k8s-standard-8 ” to create an 8 cores, 8 GB cluster or utilize “ k8s-standard-8-ha ” for a high-availability 8 cores, 8 GB cluster. utilize the high-availability template if you are creating a cluster with more than one master. Adjust “ count 1 ” to reflect the number of masters and nodes you require. Output: Request to create cluster xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx was accepted. Check cluster status While the cluster is being created, you can check its status by running: magnum cluster-list Output: $ magnum cluster-list +---+---+---+---+---+ | uuid | name | node_count | master_count | status | +---+---+---+---+---+ | xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx | my-cluster | 1 | 1 | CREATE_COMPLETE | +---+---+---+---+---+ Step 3. Accessing the Dashboard UI Once your cluster is created, you can access the UI dashboard to deploy, troubleshoot or manage your Kubernetes cluster. There are multiple ways to access the Dashboard UI. In this guide, we will utilize the kubectl command-line interface. To utilize command-line proxy, you simply run the following command: $ kubectl proxy Kubectl will handle the authentication and create your dashboard available at http://localhost:8001/ui. Notes: create sure you have kubectl installed on your desktop in order to utilize this command. The UI can only be accessed from the machine where the command is executed

Introduction Google Cloud Platform (GCloud) offers a robust suite of tools and services for managing containerized applications. One of the key components of container management is the utilize of APIs to streamline operations. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into how to master GCloud container operations using the List API. We will explore the nuances of this API, its benefits, and how it may be integrated with other services like APIPark for enhanced functionality. Understanding GCloud Container Operations Before we jump into the List API, it's crucial to comprehend the basics of GCloud container operations. Containers provide a lightweight, portable, and consistent environment for running applications. GCloud leverages Kubernetes, an open-source container orchestration platform, to manage these containers at scale. Key Components of GCloud Container Operations Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE): This is Google's managed Kubernetes service that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications. Container Registry: A private, secure, and scalable storage solution for Docker container images. Cloud Console: A web-based interface for managing GCloud resources, including container operations. gcloud CLI: A command-line tool for managing GCloud resources from the terminal. The Power of the List API The List API represents powerful tool for managing container operations on GCloud. It allows users to retrieve information about various resources, such as container clusters, nodes, and pod configurations. Here's how it works: How the List API Works API Request: You send a request to the GCloud API endpoint, specifying the type of resources you desire to list. Authentication: The API requires proper authentication using OAuth 2. Response: The API responds with a JSON object containing the list of resources and their details. Benefits of Using the List API Efficiency: Automates the retrieval of container resource information, saving time and reducing manual errors. Scalability: Handles large-scale container environments with ease. Integration: may be integrated with other tools and services for enhanced functionality. Step-by-Step Guide to Using the List API Now, let's walk through the process of using the List API for GCloud container operations. This guide assumes you have basic knowledge of GCloud and container concepts. Step 1: Set Up Your GCloud Environment Before you can utilize the List API, you require to set up your GCloud environment. This includes: Creating a GCloud Project: If you don't already have one, create a new project in the Google Cloud Console. Enabling the Google Kubernetes Engine API: Go to the API & Services > Dashboard in the Google Cloud Console and enable the Google Kubernetes Engine API for your project. Setting Up Authentication: Install and initialize the gcloud CLI tool, and authenticate it with your Google account. Step 2: Install and Configure the gcloud CLI To interact with the List API, you'll require the gcloud CLI installed and configured on your local machine. Install gcloud CLI: Follow the instructions on the official GCloud documentation to install the gcloud CLI. Initialize gcloud CLI: Run gcloud init to initialize the CLI and log in to your GCloud account. Step 3: Create a Kubernetes Cluster To manage containers, you require a Kubernetes cluster. Here's how to create one using the gcloud CLI: gcloud container clusters create "my-cluster" --zone "us-central1-a" --machine-type "n1-standard-1" Replace "my-cluster" with your preferred cluster name and "us-central1-a" with the zone where you desire to create the cluster. Step 4: List Container Clusters Using the List API To list all container clusters in your GCloud project, utilize the following command: gcloud container clusters list This command uses the List API under the hood to retrieve the list of clusters. Step 5: List Nodes in a Cluster To list the nodes in a specific cluster, utilize the following command: gcloud container nodes list --cluster "my-cluster" --zone "us-central1-a" Replace "my-cluster" with your cluster name and "us-central1-a" with your cluster zone. Step 6: List Pod Configurations To retrieve pod configurations within a specific namespace in your cluster, utilize the following command: kubectl obtain pods --namespace "default" This command uses the Kubernetes CLI ( kubectl ) to interact with the cluster. APIPark represents high-performance AI gateway that allows you to securely access the most comprehensive LLM APIs globally on the APIPark platform, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Llama2, Google Gemini, and more. attempt APIPark now! 👇👇👇 Install APIPark – it’s free Integrating List API with APIPark APIPark represents powerful API management platform that can enhance your GCloud container operations. Here's how you can integrate the List API with APIPark: Step 1: Set Up APIPark Deploy APIPark: Follow the instructions on the APIPark website to deploy APIPark on your local machine or server. Configure APIPark: Set up APIPark to manage your APIs, including authentication, rate limiting, and analytics. Step 2: Create an API in APIPark Login to APIPark: Access the APIPark dashboard and log in with your credentials. Create a New API: Click on "Create API" and fill in the required details, such as the API name, endpoint, and method. Configure Authentication: Set up OAuth 2. 0 authentication to ensure secure access to the List API. Step 3: utilize APIPark to Access the List API Send a Request: utilize APIPark to send a request to the GCloud List API endpoint. View Results: APIPark will display the response from the List API, allowing you to view and manage your container resources from a single dashboard. Best Practices for Using the List API Here are some best practices to follow when using the List API for GCloud container operations: Authentication: Always ensure that your API requests are properly authenticated to prevent unauthorized access.

NAME gcloud container clusters list - list existing clusters for running containers SYNOPSIS gcloud container clusters list [ --location = LOCATION | --region = REGION | --zone = ZONE , -z ZONE ] [ --filter = EXPRESSION ] [ --limit = LIMIT ] [ --page-size = PAGE_SIZE ] [ --sort-by =[ FIELD , …]] [ --uri ] [ GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG … ] DESCRIPTION List existing clusters for running containers. This command queries cluster across all locations unless either '--location', '--region', or '--zone' are specified. EXAMPLES To list existing clusters in all locations, run: gcloud container clusters list FLAGS At most one of these may be specified: --location = LOCATION Compute zone or region (e. us-central1-a or us-central1) for the cluster. Overrides the default compute/region or compute/zone value for this command invocation. Prefer using this flag over the --region or --zone flags. --region = REGION Compute region (e. us-central1) for a regional cluster. Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command invocation. --zone = ZONE , -z ZONE Compute zone (e. us-central1-a) for a zonal cluster. Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command invocation. LIST COMMAND FLAGS --filter = EXPRESSION Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed. If the expression evaluates True , then that item is listed. For more details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters. This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order: --flatten , --sort-by , --filter , --limit. --limit = LIMIT Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order: --flatten , --sort-by , --filter , --limit. --page-size = PAGE_SIZE Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter and --limit depending on the service. --sort-by =[ FIELD ,…] Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~´´ for descending order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order: --flatten , --sort-by , --filter , --limit. --uri Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output, and change the command output to a list of URIs. If this flag is used with --format , the formatting is applied on this URI list. To display URIs alongside other keys instead, utilize the uri() transform. GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file , --account , --billing-project , --configuration , --flags-file , --flatten , --format , --assist , --impersonate-service-account , --log-http , --project , --quiet , --trace-token , --user-output-enabled , --verbosity. Run $ gcloud assist for details. NOTES These variants are also available: gcloud alpha container clusters list gcloud beta container clusters list Send feedback
