![Kubernetes API Rate Limiting](https://github.com/AlertMend/AlertMend.io/blob/main/blogs/images/api_rate_limiting.png?raw=true)

In Kubernetes, the API server is a critical component that manages all the requests and interactions between different components of the cluster. However, when the API server is overwhelmed with too many requests, it enforces **rate limiting** to ensure cluster stability. If you‚Äôre encountering rate limiting issues, it can lead to delayed operations, throttling of requests, or even service failures. This blog post focuses on how to troubleshoot Kubernetes API rate limiting, optimize performance, and avoi...

## üîç **What is API Rate Limiting in Kubernetes?**

**Kubernetes API Rate Limiting** is a mechanism designed to control the number of requests made to the API server over a specified period of time. It ensures that the API server is not overwhelmed by high volumes of requests from various sources, including **kubectl** commands, automation scripts, controllers, or CI/CD pipelines.

While rate limiting is essential for preventing system overload, it can become a problem when legitimate requests are throttled, slowing down operations and causing performance degradation.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Why Kubernetes API Rate Limiting Happens: Common Causes**

### 1. **High Volume of Requests**
Excessive API requests from controllers, monitoring tools, or automation scripts can cause rate limiting. Common culprits include:
- Over-aggressive probes and health checks.
- Frequent `kubectl` queries.
- Automation pipelines (CI/CD) hitting the API server repeatedly.

### 2. **API Server Configuration**
Incorrect or default API server settings may impose stringent rate limits, leading to request throttling even under moderate loads.

### 3. **Insufficient Resources**
If the API server is under-resourced (CPU, memory), it may struggle to handle incoming requests, resulting in rate limiting.

### 4. **Throttling by External Components**
Components outside of Kubernetes, such as cloud providers or external proxies, may enforce their own rate limits on your API requests.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting Kubernetes API Rate Limiting**

### 1. **Check the API Server Logs for Throttling**
The first step in troubleshooting rate limiting is to check the API server logs for throttling messages:
```bash
kubectl logs <api-server-pod-name> -n kube-system
```
Look for messages like:
```
Request throttled due to client-side rate limit.
```
These logs will provide insight into which clients or services are being throttled.

### 2. **Monitor API Server Metrics**
Use monitoring tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to visualize API server request rates and throttling metrics. Prometheus can track metrics such as:
```bash
apiserver_request_count
apiserver_request_duration_seconds_bucket
apiserver_request_limiter_max_in_flight
```
This will help you identify if there are spikes in request volume or long processing times.

### 3. **Audit Request Sources**
Identify which clients or components are making the most requests to the API server. You can enable **API audit logging** to get a detailed log of all requests made to the API server:
```yaml
audit-policy.yaml:
apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1
kind: Policy
rules:
  - level: RequestResponse
    resources:
    - group: ""
      resources: ["pods"]
```
Audit logs can help pinpoint which service or tool is causing the rate limit to be triggered.

### 4. **Adjust API Server Rate Limits**
You can tune the API server rate limits by modifying the **max-requests-inflight** and **max-mutating-requests-inflight** flags. These flags control how many non-mutating and mutating requests the API server allows at any given time:
```bash
--max-requests-inflight=1000
--max-mutating-requests-inflight=500
```
By increasing these values, you may be able to reduce throttling, but it‚Äôs important to monitor resource usage to avoid overloading the API server.

### 5. **Throttle Client Requests**
If certain clients (e.g., monitoring tools, CI/CD systems) are making too many requests, configure rate limiting on the client side to reduce the load on the API server:
```yaml
rateLimits:
  qps: 5
  burst: 10
```
This helps prevent individual clients from overwhelming the API server with excessive requests.

## üõ°Ô∏è **Best Practices to Avoid Kubernetes API Rate Limiting**

### 1. **Optimize Probes and Health Checks**
Reduce the frequency of **liveness** and **readiness** probes to decrease the number of API requests they generate:
```yaml
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 8080
  periodSeconds: 10
```

### 2. **Batch API Requests**
Whenever possible, batch API requests to avoid hitting the server repeatedly with single requests. For example, retrieve pod status in bulk instead of one at a time:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n <namespace> --all-namespaces
```

### 3. **Use API Aggregation**
Distribute API requests across multiple API servers using **API aggregation**. This helps spread the load and reduces the chance of overwhelming a single API server.

### 4. **Horizontal Scaling of API Servers**
In highly dynamic environments, consider scaling your API server horizontally by adding additional replicas to distribute the incoming request load more effectively.

### 5. **Leverage Caching**
Use caching mechanisms in your automation scripts or monitoring tools to reduce the number of repetitive API calls. Tools like **Kubernetes Dashboard** or **kubectl-watch** can cache results locally.

### 6. **Implement Retry Logic for Automation Scripts**
For scripts or tools interacting with the Kubernetes API, implement retry logic to handle intermittent rate-limiting errors without causing failures. This helps prevent unnecessary service disruptions.
