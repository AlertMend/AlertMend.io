# üö® **Elasticsearch Cluster Health Showing Red: Causes, Troubleshooting, and Solutions**
---

When your **Elasticsearch cluster health status** turns **red**, it indicates critical issues that must be addressed immediately. A red health status means some primary shards are unassigned, which could cause data loss or make your cluster unstable. This guide will help you understand the causes of a red cluster health status, how to troubleshoot the issues, and what steps to take to restore your cluster‚Äôs functionality.

## üîç **What Causes a Red Cluster Health Status?**

Several factors can lead to a red cluster health status in Elasticsearch:
- **Unassigned Shards**: One of the most common reasons for red cluster health is that primary shards remain unassigned.
- **Node Failures**: If one or more nodes in the cluster fail, the cluster may turn red, especially if those nodes contain primary shards.
- **Disk Space Issues**: Insufficient disk space on nodes can prevent shards from being allocated properly.
- **Network Failures**: Poor network connectivity between nodes can disrupt data replication or recovery.
- **Corrupted Indices**: Software bugs or misconfiguration may cause index corruption, affecting shard assignment.

## üõ†Ô∏è **How to Troubleshoot Elasticsearch Red Cluster Health**

### 1. **Check Elasticsearch Service Status**
Ensure that the Elasticsearch service is up and running:
```bash
sudo systemctl status elasticsearch
```
If the service is down, try restarting it:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart elasticsearch
```

### 2. **Check Cluster Health**
Start by checking the current health of the cluster to get a high-level view:
```bash
curl -X GET ${ELASTICSEARCH_URL}/_cluster/health
```
This will return the overall health, unassigned shards, and node availability. Investigate further if the status is red or yellow.

### 3. **Inspect Shard Allocation**
Check for any unassigned shards that could be causing the red health status:
```bash
curl -X GET ${ELASTICSEARCH_URL}/_cluster/allocation/explain?pretty
```
This command will explain why the shards are not allocated and suggest potential fixes. Ensure that any node failure, storage issue, or allocation settings are correctly managed.

### 4. **Check Node Status and Logs**
Ensure that all nodes are active and communicating:
```bash
curl -X GET ${ELASTICSEARCH_URL}/_cat/nodes?v
```
Investigate the logs for any errors, particularly focusing on memory, disk, or network failures:
```bash
sudo grep -i "error" ${ELASTICSEARCH_LOG_FILE_PATH}
```
Check for entries related to memory pressure, disk space issues, or unresponsive nodes.

### 5. **Check Disk Usage and Free Up Space**
Check the disk usage on all nodes to ensure that there is sufficient space for shard allocation:
```bash
df -h ${ELASTICSEARCH_DATA_DIRECTORY}
```
Free up space, delete old indices using **Elasticsearch Curator**, or add additional storage if necessary. Also, verify that **node-level disk watermarks** are properly configured to prevent future disk-related issues:
```bash
curl -X PUT ${ELASTICSEARCH_URL}/_cluster/settings -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "persistent": {
    "cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.low": "85%",
    "cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.high": "90%",
    "cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.flood_stage": "95%"
  }
}'
```

### 6. **Investigate Shard Reallocation and Recovery**
If the primary shards are unassigned due to node failure or disk space issues, you can trigger shard reallocation:
```bash
curl -X POST ${ELASTICSEARCH_URL}/_cluster/reroute?retry_failed
```
This command forces Elasticsearch to reassign unallocated shards. Additionally, check the current allocation settings:
```bash
curl -X GET ${ELASTICSEARCH_URL}/_cluster/settings
```
This will help you confirm that the allocation rules are configured correctly.

## üõ°Ô∏è **Best Practices for Preventing Red Cluster Health in Elasticsearch**

### 1. **Monitor Disk Space and Node Health**
Ensure that you have real-time monitoring of disk space, node health, and memory usage using tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana**. Set alerts to prevent disk exhaustion. Regularly monitor **node-to-node communication** and **network latency** as these can lead to cluster-wide issues.

### 2. **Use Replication for Data Redundancy**
Always configure your cluster with sufficient replication. This way, if a node fails, the replica shards can take over:
```yaml
index.number_of_replicas: 1
```
Ensure your system has sufficient resources to accommodate both primary and replica shards.

### 3. **Use Curator for Index Management**
Use the **Elasticsearch Curator** to manage indices and delete older data to prevent overloading storage:
```bash
curator_cli delete_indices --filter_list '{"filtertype":"age","source":"creation_date","direction":"older","unit":"days","unit_count":30}'
```

### 4. **Increase Cluster Resilience by Scaling Nodes**
Add more nodes to the cluster to distribute the load and reduce the risk of primary shards becoming unavailable due to node failure. Adjust **recovery and allocation settings** for improved resilience:
```bash
curl -X PUT ${ELASTICSEARCH_URL}/_cluster/settings -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "persistent": {
    "cluster.routing.allocation.node_concurrent_recoveries": 5
  }
}'
```
This helps the cluster recover faster during shard reallocation after node failure.

### 5. **Shard Management and Optimal Resource Allocation**
Optimize the number of shards per index based on your node resources. Avoid oversharding as it increases overhead. Use a balanced number of **primary and replica shards**:
```bash
curl -X PUT "${ELASTICSEARCH_URL}/<index-name>/_settings" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "index" : {
    "number_of_shards" : 3,
    "number_of_replicas" : 2
  }
}'
```
Also, regularly monitor and adjust the **refresh interval** for high-throughput clusters.
