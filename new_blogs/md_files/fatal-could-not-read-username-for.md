This problem occurred when I cloned a repo using HTTPS URL and then tried to push the changes (using Shell on Linux/Mac or Git Bash on Windows): git clone https://github. com/{username}/{repo}. git However, when I used SSH URL to clone, this problem didn't occur: git clone [email protected] :{username}/{repo}. git In case you already cloned the repo using HTTPS and don't desire to redo everything, you may utilize set-url to change the origin URL to SSH URL : git remote set-url origin [email protected] :{username}/{repo}. git Note: I have SSH key added to my GitHub account. Without setting up SSH key, this method will not work either. BTW, git clone or pull should work without any of these changes. These are needed only when you git push after clone.

For example, this is the error I got when trying to clone a GitHub URL that was a few characters off: $ git clone -v http://github. com/username/repo-name. git Cloning into 'repo-name'. Username for 'https://github. com': Password for 'https://github. com': remote: Repository not found. fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github. com/username/repo-name. git/' It actually happened inside Emacs, though, so the error in Emacs looked like this: fatal: could not read Username for ’https://github. com’: No such device or address So instead of a helpful error saying that there was no such repo at that URL, it gave me that, sending me on a wild goose chase until I finally realized that the URL was incorrect. This is with git version 2.

You probably have the config variable 'credential. helper' set to either wincred or winstore and it is failing to clear it.

If there is nothing there as mentioned then check your config - git config --global -l | grep credential. If there is anything output, that shall be the utility that is trying to feed your stored credentials to the server when you push. 307Z+00:00 0 Reply Copy link noobie-php noobie-php Over a year ago Mate i think this isnt the problem let me elaborate on , may be you obtain what i am trying to say, git remote add origin https://github. com/username/Hello-World. git the username which is tied onto this git repo link is making trouble, i dont think my OWN username is making trouble here. As far as i understand Credential manger helps managing personal credentials, not the credentials of repository. 863Z+00:00 2 Reply Copy link Add a comment 1 In my case I had to setup "personal access token" under GitHub: settings -> developer settings and enable SSO.

So if you're setting up, go for a fine grained with all repo related boxes ticked (like repo:read, repo:write etc) and meta info related. 74Z+00:00 0 Reply Copy link 1 If you're encountering this error while running go mod download within a Dockerfile, I experienced a similar issue. What resolved it for me was implementing the following changes in my Dockerfile: RUN go env -w GOPRIVATE="github. com" RUN git config --global url. "ssh:// [email protected] ". insteadOf "https://github. com" RUN mkdir -p /root/. ssh && ssh-keyscan github. ssh/known_hosts RUN --mount=type=secret,id=sshKey,dst=/root/. ssh/id_rsa go mod download This sets the private repository to utilize SSH instead of HTTPS and ensures that go mod download uses the correct SSH key.

Do this: Check if you typed in the name of the repository right. I was looking for answer for a good while and all I had to do was check the name of the repository.

I'm guessing this is probably to check if it's a private repo you have access to. Possibly to create it harder to enumerate private repos.

For me, I got this error when I changed a public repo to a private one. It's clear to me now that a public repo needs no auth, yet a private one does. Hope this helps clarify why the error occurs and one potential trigger for that cause.

Set up SSH authentication for your GitHub account and update the repository URL in your deployment script to utilize the SSH format ( [email protected] :/.

There was an error while loading. Please reload this page. Quote reply icasimpan Apr 21, 2021 - Hi, Our company has an opensource project that we desire to sync to drupal’s git repo. So taking an inspiration from a drupal-based project, I took the relevant code and tweaked it a bit to fit our situation. I do have the needed access to drupal’s project repo and I’m using the same credentials for this github actions. The github actions yaml file is in provus/develop-sync. yml at 26a3f180516dadea9539065968906f088ae46790 · promet/provus · GitHub I even explicitly added my username (icasimpan) to secrets. DRUPAL_REPO_URL but I still observe the issue fatal: could not read Username for ‘XXXXXX’: No such device or address this may be seen in Test push · promet/provus@26a3f18 · GitHub I wonder what I’m missing as I’ve tried anything I could discover on the net but still failed.
