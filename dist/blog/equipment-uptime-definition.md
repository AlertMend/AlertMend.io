Uptime is the ratio of the total time during which a machinery or equipment is operational or the production time to the total available time, that is the total time for which the machinery or equipment is available. It is the opposite of downtime, which is the ratio of the total time during which the machinery or equipment is non-operational to the total available time. Formula: Operational uptime is expressed as a percentage and is calculated as follows – Example: Suppose the operations team at XYZ Corp. wants to utilize a machine for carrying out their day-to-day operations. The machine is available for a total of 10 hours every day. It takes around 2 hours to setup the machine, another 1. 5 hours to set it back down, and needs to be allowed to cool down for 15 minutes after every 1. 5 hours of production.

This metric takes into account all possible stoppages, both scheduled and unscheduled, for a more complete representation of the amount of time a production line is up and running. Manufacturers who keep track of uptime can identify any increase in stoppages and are more likely to spot maintenance issues or plant breakdowns early on. Plant uptime is calculated by dividing scheduled operating time by the process’s actual operating time. In this formula, the actual operating time is the total available time to run after subtracting scheduled and unscheduled downtime. Downtime, the periods of time in which the production line is not operation and/or not available to operate, is seen as one of the biggest wastes in manufacturing. Causes of downtime include planned maintenance, employee breaks, adjustments, changeovers, etc. , Excessive downtime not only wastes time and money, but it can easily lead to issues with quality and performance. While plant uptime or production uptime are common calculations in manufacturing and industrial environments, some facilities measure downtime incurred during a shift and others will characterize each downtime “event” as being caused operationally, electrically, or mechanically. This can assist to measure failures in industrial production equipment or provide more accurate data about the specific error, malfunction, outage, or cause of downtime. The metric of uptime is highly similar to the OEE factor availability and like plant uptime, takes total run time, planned stops, and unplanned stops into account; any unplanned downtime will lower the availability percentage. In order to effectively reduce downtime with the OEE formula, an accurate availability ratio is key. Furthermore, the more accurate data a manufacturer keeps, the easier it is to analyze trends, plan improvement projects, and evaluate success.

Uptime represents computer industry term for the time during which a computer or IT system is operational. Uptime can also be a metric that represents the percentage of time that hardware, a computer network, or a device is successfully operational. Uptime is often measured in percentiles, such as “five 9s,” meaning a system that is operational 99. 999 percent of the time. Downtime , the opposite of uptime, is the period of time when a system is not operational. The terms uptime and downtime are used to define the level of success provided by real-time services. A service level agreement (SLA) or other real-time service contract may include uptime/downtime ratios that demonstrate how much time a service is expected to remain operational. IT professionals may utilize uptime to refer to a total consecutive amount of operational time. For example, a computer system that was running for three weeks has a “three-week uptime. ” High availability uses uptime to define an agreed level of operational performance measured against a 100 percent operational standard. Uptime is often used as a sign of operating system or network reliability, representing the length of time a system may be left unattended without crashing or needing maintenance. Hardware reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) are crucial factors in data center uptime. Redundant servers for backup and failover assist maintain data center uptime in case of server failure. Server clustering is another uptime strategy that delivers high availability of IT services and workloads. A server cluster represents group of linked servers that work together to improve system performance, load balancing and service availability. If a server fails, other servers in the cluster can take over the functions and workloads of the failed server. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server can assist maximize uptime by providing server clustering, by exploiting hardware RAS features, and by enabling live kernel patching without rebooting

By Gavin Wright Published: Jun 22, 2023 What is uptime and downtime in computing? In computing, uptime represents measure of how long a computer or service is on and available. Downtime is the measure of how long it is not available. Services measure uptime as a percentage of total time. What is uptime? Uptime tells users how long a computer or service was available. Historically, uptime was mainly a measure of the consecutive time a single computer was powered on before it was rebooted or powered off. This could be shown with the simple uptime command. Some system administrators would take pride in having long uptimes, sometimes measured in years. They might take extreme measures such as avoiding updates or applying patches to a live system. 999% availability is the gold standard for uptime reliability. Modern high availability services no longer rely on a single computer to run. Clustered and balanced servers allow for a server to go down without affecting the entire service. Phased rollouts apply patches and updates to groups of servers at a time instead of all servers to allow for some servers to be available while others are restarted. Service availability is now a better measure of service reliability than just uptime. This is often expressed as a percentage of available time versus unavailable time. Even 99% is unacceptable for many services. This would translate to roughly three days of downtime each year. Instead, it is measured in the number of "nines" of availability. 999% availability -- is considered the gold standard. This represents only about five minutes of downtime a year. How to increase uptime Strategies to increase uptime include the following: Minimize single points of failure. utilize redundant systems with automatic failover. Schedule maintenance periods. What is downtime? Downtime tells users how long a service is unavailable. Downtime may be planned due to maintenance or unplanned due to an outage. It is impossible to eliminate downtime, but it is crucial to attempt to minimize it. Downtime usually represents lost money due to lost revenue, unhappy customers or lost worker productivity. Planned and unplanned downtime may be covered differently depending on the service-level agreement. How to decrease downtime Strategies to decrease downtime include the following: Have a business continuity and disaster recovery plan. utilize change management procedures with rollback plans. Test failover systems. Be prepared for planned and unplanned downtime and consider reliability, availability and serviceability when designing, manufacturing, purchasing and using computer products and services. observe why network monitoring tools must offer more insights upfront , learn about device reliability engineering and how it promotes product reliability, and explore the Uptime Institute's data center availability tier standards.
