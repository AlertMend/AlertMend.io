The building was commissioned by Ping An Insurance and designed by the American architectural firm Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates. The design of the building is meant to be unique and elegant, and to represent the history and achievements of the main tenant. A stainless-steel facade that weighs approximately 1,700 metric tons (3,700,000 lb) provides a modern design to the building. [ 3 ] It is the second largest skyscraper in the world by floor area after Azabudai Hills Main Tower in Tokyo , Japan. The building has a gross floor area of 378,600 m 2 (4,075,000 sq ft). The 115-storey tower has a width-to-height aspect ratio of 1:10 and also has an 11-story podium. Including the podium, the building has 495,520 m 2 (5,333,700 sq ft) of floor space. A five-level basement adds 90,000 m 2 (970,000 sq ft). The 620,000-metric-ton (1. 37 × 10 9 lb) tower has eight main columns which form the superstructure. The column dimensions range from approximately 6 by 3. 2 m (19 ft 8 in by 10 ft 6 in) at the lowest level to 2. 4 m (9 ft 6 in by 4 ft 7 in) at the top of the tower. [ 3 ] Phase 2 [ edit ] The second building of the project, a 290-metre (950 ft), 47-story skyscraper known as the South Tower, was completed. Construction began in April 2014 and it opened in 2018/19. The complex includes a 5-star Park Hyatt hotel, a planned retail bridge connecting the two skyscrapers from levels 3 through 6. [ 12 ] Elevators [ edit ] The Ping An International Finance Center is equipped with 33 double deck elevators, [ 2 ] travelling at maximum speeds of up to 10 m/s (2,000 ft/min).

Its 18,391 m 2 (197,960 sq ft) lot was purchased by Ping An Group via auction at a price of 1. 6568 billion RMB on 6 November 2007. Design of the building began in 2008 with Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates providing the architectural design and Thornton Tomasetti providing structural design. [ 3 ] Its foundation stone was laid on 29 August 2009, and construction started in November the same year. China Construction First Building Group was hired as the general contractor to construct the building. [ 3 ] In March 2013, the construction process was temporarily halted, due to the suspected utilize of concrete made with unprocessed sea sand, which could corrode the steel structure. [ 16 ] Construction resumed on the building after sample testing. [ citation needed ] On the morning of 15 July 2014, upon a 10-metre (33 ft)-long steel column being lifted to place, the skyscraper exceeded 443. 8 metres (1,456 ft) in height, surpassing the KK100 Tower to become the tallest building in Shenzhen. The building was topped out on 30 April 2015, and became the second tallest skyscraper in China at a height of 599. The original plan was to add a 60-metre (200 ft)-long antenna atop the building to surpass the Shanghai Tower and become the tallest building in China. However, in February 2015, it was decided that the antenna would not top the tower due to the possibility that it might obstruct flight paths. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Climbing attempts [ edit ] The Ping An Financial Center building was the subject of frequent rooftopping attempts. In January 2015, daredevil Malaysian photographer Keow Wee Loong climbed the then incomplete building and released video footage and a photo taken from a crane at the tower's top. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] The structure was subsequently climbed during the period of the Chinese New Year on 19 February 2015 by two Russian and Ukrainian urban explorers , Vadim Makhorov and Vitaly Raskalov from Ontheroofs , who further climbed out to a crane above the under-construction tower and documented their ascent with video and photos. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] Previous status [ edit ] Low occupancy [ edit ] According to South China Morning Post , almost 30 percent of the office space remained empty in the second quarter of 2019.

API Ping Comprehensive API and website testing platform More details API Ping represents comprehensive platform that enables developers to easily and effectively test REST APIs and static websites. With API Ping, users can quickly create and execute simple or complex tests, define assertions based on XPath or JSONPath, and receive notifications when tests fail. By providing a user-friendly interface and a variety of testing options, API Ping saves developers time and effort and helps ensure that their projects function as intended. Easy Test Automation API Ping offers a simple and intuitive way to create and automate tests for REST APIs and static websites. With the ability to create simple "pings" or complex tests scripted via an online Hurl editor, API Ping allows users to run tests automatically at scheduled intervals. This feature saves time and improves testing efficiency, allowing users to quickly identify and resolve issues with their projects. Assertions With API Ping, users can define assertions based on XPath to navigate through HTML or JSONPath to walk through the JSON response returned from the server. This feature allows for flexible testing that can adapt to the specific needs of each project. Users can easily create custom assertions and manage them from within the platform, making it easy to fine-tune their tests and ensure accurate and reliable results. CI/CD Pipelines API Ping's REST API endpoints feature provides an easy way to integrate testing into Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. By generating an API token in the API Ping dashboard and using it to call the REST API endpoints, users can schedule tests automatically and receive detailed results that may be integrated into their pipeline. This feature allows for seamless integration of testing into the CI/CD process, ensuring that changes to code are thoroughly tested before being deployed. Additionally, by pulling data from the API Ping dashboard via the REST API, users can create custom dashboards that display key metrics and testing results, providing greater visibility into the testing process and allowing users to identify patterns and trends over time. Reporting API Ping platform provides comprehensive reporting that includes detailed logs and reports that demonstrate exactly what happened during each test. The platform provides color-coded alerts to quickly identify which tests passed and which failed. Users can access the results of their tests directly from the dashboard, and receive email notifications when a test fails. This feature provides peace of mind and helps users stay on top of any issues that arise with their projects

Ping API Ping API #340430 Description The /ping resource is used to check the status of the Densify API subsystem. No credentials are required for this resource to validate the API subsystem. A ping API call performs an end-to-end test from the client to the API subsystem, ensuring that the Densify database is available and is able to respond to requests. Network elements, such as load balancers, can utilize this resource to verify that the web server receiving the request may be kept as an active participant in the resource pool. Resource /CIRBA/api/ping Supported Operations Table: Ping API Supported Operations Operation HTTP Method Input Output Description Ping the Densify API subsystem obtain /CIRBA/api/ping Query String Parameter: timeout (optional) message status Used to return the status of a connectivity test to the Densify API subsystem with no authorization. observe Response Elements for the returned output. Example: Successful Ping API Parameters Query String Parameters Table: Ping API Query String Parameters Parameter Name Type Description timeout (optional) integer The maximum time, in seconds, for the Densify API Server to respond before returning a timeout error. If the timeout parameter is not specified, then the default timeout is set to 30 seconds. The valid range of timeout is between 15 and 180 seconds. Specifying any value outside of the valid range will produce a malformed request error. Example: Ping API Timeout Response Response Elements The following table list elements and possible status codes returned from the /ping request. Element Type Description message string Detailed message of the status response. status errorCode HTTP Response Code Possible response code values of the /ping request include: 200—Successful response: API subsystem is responding to requests; 400—The provided timeout value was invalid (outside the range of 15 - 180 seconds). 500—There is an issue connecting to the Densify API subsystem. Contact Densify support [email protected] for further details. Note: Other response error messages could indicate issues with the Densify web server or other connectivity issues to the web server. Examples Example: Successful Ping API The following example shows you a ping request to the Densify API subsystem with a timeout threshold of 100 seconds. Example: Successful Ping API Request: obtain /CIRBA/api/ping?timeout=100 Response: { "message" : "ok", "status" : 200 } Example: Ping API Timeout The following example shows you a ping request with an invalid timeout value. Example: Ping API Timeout Request: obtain /CIRBA/api/ping?timeout=10 Response: { "message" : "Timeout value valid range: 15-180", "status" : 400 }

FastAPI documentation : https://fastapi. com This tutorial app source code (GitLab repo) : Please, for more comprehension access the repo https://gitlab. com/rhkina/fastapi as you follow this tutorial! FastAPI represents modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3. 6+ based on standard Python type hints. Historically, async work in Python was nontrivial (though its API has rapidly improved since Python 3. 4) particularly with Flask. Essentially, Flask (on most WSGI servers) is blocking by default - work triggered by a request to a particular endpoint will hold the server entirely until that request is completed. Instead, Flask (or rather, the WSGI server running it, like gunicorn or uWSGI ) achieve scaling by running multiple worker instances of the app in parallel, such that requests may be farmed to other workers while one is busy. Within a single worker, asynchronous work may be wrapped in a blocking call (the route function itself is still blocking), threaded (in newer versions of Flask), or farmed to a queue manager like Celery - but there isn’t a single consistent story where routes can cleanly handle asynchronous requests without additional tooling. FastAPI is designed from the ground up to run asynchronously - thanks to its underlying starlette ASGI framework, route functions default to running within an asynchronous event loop. With a good ASGI server (FastAPI is designed to couple to uvicorn , running on top of uvloop ) this can obtain us performance on par with fast asynchronous webservers in Go or Node, without losing the benefits of Python’s broader machine learning ecosystem. In contrast to messing with threads or Celery queues to achieve asynchronous execution in Flask, running an endpoint asynchronously is dead simple in FastAPI - we simply declare the route function as asynchronous (with async def ) and we’re ready to go! We can even do this if the route function isn’t conventionally asynchronous - that is, we don’t have any awaitable calls (like if the endpoint is running inference against an ML model). In fact, unless the endpoint is specifically performing a blocking IO operation (to a database, for example), it’s better to declare the function with async def (as blocking functions are actually punted to an external threadpool and then awaited anyhow). The key features are: Fast : highly high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). One of the fastest Python frameworks available. Fast to code : Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. * Fewer bugs : Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. * Intuitive : Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Easy : Designed to be easy to utilize and learn. Less time reading docs. Short : Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Robust : obtain production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation. Standards-based : Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema. * estimation based on tests performed by internal development team. Tutorial Note : original blog to this tutorial from Michael Herman at testdriven. Objectives I have the following objectives with this repo: Develop an asynchronous RESTful API with Python and FastAPI Practice Test-Driven Development Test a FastAPI app with Pytest Interact with a Postgres database asynchronously Containerize FastAPI and Postgres inside a Docker container Parameterize test functions and mock functionality in tests with Pytest Document a RESTful API with Swagger/OpenAPI Project Setup Create the following structure: fastapi ├── docker-compose. yml └── src ├── Dockerfile ├── app │ ├── __init__. txt Add FastAPI and Uvicorn to the requirements file: fastapi==0. py, create a new instance of FastAPI and set up a sanity check route: from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI() @app. obtain("/ping") def pong(): return {"ping": "pong!"} Add the following lines in the Dockerfile (at src directory): # pull official base image FROM python:3. 1-alpine # set work directory WORKDIR /usr/src/app # set environment variables ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1 ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1 # copy requirements file COPY. txt /usr/src/app/requirements. txt # install dependencies RUN set -eux \ && apk add --no-cache --virtual. build-deps build-base \ libressl-dev libffi-dev gcc musl-dev python3-dev \ && pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel \ && pip install -r /usr/src/app/requirements. txt \ && rm -rf /root/. cache/pip # copy project COPY. /usr/src/app/ Here we started an Alpine-based Docker image for Python 3. 1 and set a working directory defining two environment variables: PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE : Prevents Python from writing pyc files to disc (equivalent to python -B option) PYTHONUNBUFFERED : Prevents Python from buffering stdout and stderr (equivalent to python -u option) Finally, we copied over the requirements. txt file, installed some system-level dependencies, updated Pip, installed the requirements, and copied over the FastAPI app itself. Next, add the following to the docker-compose. yml file in the project root: version: '2. 0' services: web: build:. /src command: uvicorn app. main:app --reload --workers 1 --host 0. 0 --port 8000 volumes: -. /src/:/usr/src/app/ ports: - 8002:8000 So, when the container spins up, Uvicorn will run with the following settings: --reload enables auto-reload so the server will restart after changes are made to the code base. --workers 1 provides a single worker process. 0 defines the address to host the server on. --port 8000 defines the port to host the server on. main:app tells Uvicorn where it can discover the FastAPI ASGI application - e. , within the 'app' module, you'll discover the ASGI app, app = FastAPI() , in the main. Build the image and spin up the container: $ docker-compose up -d --build Navigate to http://localhost:8002/ping. You should observe: {"ping":"pong!"} You'll also be able to view the interactive API documentation, powered by Swagger UI, at http://localhost:8002/docs : Test setup Create a tests folder in src and then add an __init__. py file to tests along with a test_main. py file: from starlette. testclient import TestClient from app. main import app client = TestClient(app) def test_ping(): response = client. obtain("/ping") assert response. status_code == 200 assert response. json() == {"ping": "pong!"} Here, we imported Starlette's TestClient , which uses the Requests library to create requests against the FastAPI app. Add Pytest and Requests to requirements. 0 Update the image and then run the tests: $ docker-compose up -d --build $ docker-compose exec web pytest. You should observe something like this: ========================================== test session starts ========================================== platform linux -- Python 3. 1 rootdir: /usr/src/app collected 1 item tests/test_main. [100%] =========================================== 1 passed in 0. 48s =========================================== Add a test_app Pytest fixture to a new file called src/tests/conftest. py : import pytest from starlette. testclient import TestClient from app. main import app @pytest. fixture(scope="module") def test_app(): client = TestClient(app) yield client # testing happens here Update the test_main. py file as well so that it uses the fixture: def test_ping(test_app): response = client. obtain("/ping") assert response. status_code == 200 assert response. json() == {"ping": "pong!"} Your project structure should now look like this: fastapi ├── docker-compose. yml └── src ├── Dockerfile ├── app │ ├── __init__. txt └── tests ├── __init__. py Async Handlers Let's convert the synchronous handler over to an asynchronous one. Rather than having to go through the trouble of spinning up a task queue (like Celery or RQ) or utilizing threads, FastAPI makes it easy to deliver routes asynchronously. As long as you don't have any blocking I/O calls in the handler, you can simply declare the handler as asynchronous by just adding the async keyword like so (modify main. obtain("/ping") async def pong(): # some async operation could happen here # example: `notes = await get_all_notes()` return {"ping": "pong!"} That's it! Update the handler in your code, and then create sure the tests still pass: $ docker-compose up -d --build $ docker-compose exec web pytest. ========================================== test session starts ========================================== platform linux -- Python 3. 1 rootdir: /usr/src/app collected 1 item tests/test_main. [100%] =========================================== 1 passed in 0. 03s =========================================== Routes Next, let's set up the basic CRUD routes, following RESTful best practices: Endpoint HTTP Method CRUD Method Result /notes/ obtain READ obtain all notes /notes/:id obtain READ obtain a single note /notes/ POST CREATE add a note /notes/:id PUT UPDATE update a note /notes/:id DELETE DELETE delete a note For each route, we will: Write a test Run the test to ensure it fails (red) Write just enough code to obtain the test to pass (green) Refactor Before diving in, let's add some structure to better organize the CRUD routes with FastAPI's APIRouter. You can break up and modularize larger projects as well as apply versioning to your API with the APIRouter. If you're familiar with Flask, it is equivalent to a Blueprint. Add a new folder called api to the app folder, and add an __init__. py file to the newly created folder. Now we can move the /ping route to a new file called src/app/api/ping. py : from fastapi import APIRouter router = APIRouter() @router. obtain("/ping") async def pong(): # some async operation could happen here # example: `notes = await get_all_notes()` return {"ping": "pong!"} Then, update main. py like so to remove the old route and wire the router up to our main app: from fastapi import FastAPI from app. api import ping app = FastAPI() app. router) Rename test_main. create sure http://localhost:8002/ping and http://localhost:8002/docs still work. Also, be sure the tests still pass before moving on. $ docker-compose up -d --build $ docker-compose exec web pytest. ========================================== test session starts ========================================== platform linux -- Python 3. 1 rootdir: /usr/src/app collected 1 item tests/test_ping. [100%] =========================================== 1 passed in 0. 04s =========================================== Postgres setup To configure Postgres, we'll require to add a new service to the docker-compose. yml file, add the appropriate environment variables, and install asyncpg. First, add a new service called db to docker-compose. 0' services: web: build:. /src command: uvicorn app. main:app --reload --workers 1 --host 0. 0 --port 8000 volumes: -. /src/:/usr/src/app/ ports: - 8002:8000 environment: - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://hello_fastapi:hello_fastapi@db/hello_fastapi_dev db: image: postgres:12. 1-alpine volumes: - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/ environment: - POSTGRES_USER=hello_fastapi - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=hello_fastapi - POSTGRES_DB=hello_fastapi_dev volumes: postgres_data: To persist the data beyond the life of the container we configured a volume. This config will bind postgres_data to the /var/lib/postgresql/data/ directory in the container. We also added an environment key to define a name for the default database and set a username and password. Review the "Environment Variables" section of the Postgres Docker Hub page for more info. Update the Dockerfile to install the appropriate packages required for asyncpg : # pull official base image FROM python:3. 1-alpine # set work directory WORKDIR /usr/src/app # set environment variables ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1 ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1 # copy requirements file COPY. txt /usr/src/app/requirements. txt # install dependencies RUN set -eux \ && apk add --no-cache --virtual. build-deps build-base \ libressl-dev libffi-dev gcc musl-dev python3-dev \ postgresql-dev \ && pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel \ && pip install -r /usr/src/app/requirements. txt \ && rm -rf /root/. cache/pip # copy project COPY. /usr/src/app/ Add asyncpg to src/requirements. py file to src/app : import os from databases import Database from sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData DATABASE_URL = os. getenv("DATABASE_URL") # SQLAlchemy engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL) metadata = MetaData() # databases query builder database = Database(DATABASE_URL) Here, using the database URI and credentials that we just configured in the Docker Compose file, we created a SQLAlchemy engine (used for communicating with the database) along with a Metadata instance (used for creating the database schema). We also created a new Database instance from databases. databases is an async SQL query builder that works on top of the SQLAlchemy Core expression language. It supports the following methods: database. fetch_all(query) database. fetch_one(query) database. iterate(query) database. execute(query) database. execute_many(query) Review the Async SQL (Relational) Databases guide and the Starlette Database docs for more details on working with databases asynchronously. Update the requirements. 0 databases[postgresql]==0. 0 Models SQLAlchemy Model Add a notes model to src/app/db. py : import os from sqlalchemy import (Column, DateTime, Integer, MetaData, String, Table, create_engine) from sqlalchemy. sql import func from databases import Database DATABASE_URL = os. getenv("DATABASE_URL") # SQLAlchemy engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL) metadata = MetaData() notes = Table( "notes", metadata, Column("id", Integer, primary_key=True), Column("title", String(50)), Column("description", String(50)), Column("created_date", DateTime, default=func. now(), nullable=False), ) # databases query builder database = Database(DATABASE_URL) Wire up the database and the model in main. py and add startup and shutdown event handlers for connecting to and disconnecting from the database: from fastapi import FastAPI from app. api import notes, ping from app. db import engine, metadata, database metadata. create_all(engine) app = FastAPI() @app. on_event("startup") async def startup(): await database. on_event("shutdown") async def shutdown(): await database. router) Build the new image and spin up the two containers: $ docker-compose up -d --build Ensure the notes table was created: $ docker-compose exec db psql --username=hello_fastapi --dbname=hello_fastapi_dev psql (12. 1) Type "assist" for assist. hello_fastapi_dev=# \l List of databases Name | Owner | Encoding | Collate | Ctype | Access privileges -------------------+---------------+----------+------------+------------+--------------------------------- hello_fastapi_dev | hello_fastapi | UTF8 | en_US. utf8 | postgres | hello_fastapi | UTF8 | en_US. utf8 | template0 | hello_fastapi | UTF8 | en_US. utf8 | =c/hello_fastapi + | | | | | hello_fastapi=CTc/hello_fastapi template1 | hello_fastapi | UTF8 | en_US. utf8 | =c/hello_fastapi + | | | | | hello_fastapi=CTc/hello_fastapi (4 rows) hello_fastapi_dev=# \c hello_fastapi_dev You are now connected to database "hello_fastapi_dev" as user "hello_fastapi". hello_fastapi_dev=# \dt List of relations Schema | Name | Type | Owner --------+-------+-------+--------------- public | notes | table | hello_fastapi (1 row) hello_fastapi_dev=# \q Pydantic model First time using pydantic? View pydantic Overview for more details. Create a NoteSchema pydantic model with two required fields, title and description , in a new file called models. py in src/app/api : from pydantic import BaseModel class NoteSchema(BaseModel): title: str description: str NoteSchema shall be used for validating the payloads for creating and updating notes. POST route We will break the normal TDD flow for this route in order to establish the coding pattern that we'll utilize for the remaining routes. Code Create a new file called notes. py in the src/app/api folder: from app. api import crud from app. models import NoteDB, NoteSchema from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException router = APIRouter() @router. post("/", response_model=NoteDB, status_code=201) async def create_note(payload: NoteSchema): note_id = await crud. post(payload) response_object = { "id": note_id, "title": payload. title, "description": payload. description, } return response_object Here, we defined a handler that expects a payload, payload: NoteSchema , with a title and a description. Essentially, when the route is hit with a POST request, FastAPI will read the body of the request and validate the data: - If valid, the data shall be available in the payload parameter. FastAPI also generates JSON Schema definitions that are then used to automatically generate the OpenAPI schema and the API documentation. - If invalid, an error is immediately returned. Review the Request Body for more info. Note that we used the async declaration here since the database communication shall be asynchronous. In other words, there are no blocking I/O operations in the handler. Next, create a new file called crud. py in the src/app/api folder: from app. models import NoteSchema from app. db import notes, database async def post(payload: NoteSchema): query = notes. title, description=payload. description) return await database. execute(query=query) We added a utility function called post for creating new notes that takes a payload object and then: Creates a SQLAlchemy insert object expression query. Executes the query and returns the generated ID. Next, we require to define a new pydantic model for utilize as the response_model : @router. post("/", response_model=NoteDB, status_code=201) Update models. py like so: from pydantic import BaseModel class NoteSchema(BaseModel): title: str description: str class NoteDB(NoteSchema): id: int The NoteDB model inherits from the NoteSchema model, adding an id field. Wire up the new router in main. api import notes, ping from app. db import database, engine, metadata from fastapi import FastAPI metadata. create_all(engine) app = FastAPI() @app. on_event("startup") async def startup(): await database. on_event("shutdown") async def shutdown(): await database. router, prefix="/notes", tags=["notes"]) Take note of the prefix URL along with the notes tag , which shall be applied to the OpenAPI schema (for grouping operations ). Test it out with curl or HTTPie : $ http --json POST http://localhost:8002/notes/ title=foo description=bar You should observe something like: HTTP/1. 1 201 Created content-length: 42 content-type: application/json date: Sun, 12 Apr 2020 04:39:56 GMT server: uvicorn { "description": "bar", "id": 1, "title": "foo" } You can also interact with the endpoint at http://localhost:8002/docs/. Test Add the following test to a new test file called src/tests/test_notes. py : import json import pytest from app. api import crud def test_create_note(test_app, monkeypatch): test_request_payload = {"title": "something", "description": "something else"} test_response_payload = {"id": 1, "title": "something", "description": "something else"} async def mock_post(payload): return 1 monkeypatch. setattr(crud, "post", mock_post) response = test_app. post("/notes/", data=json. dumps(test_request_payload),) assert response. status_code == 201 assert response. json() == test_response_payload def test_create_note_invalid_json(test_app): response = test_app. post("/notes/", data=json. dumps({"title": "something"})) assert response. status_code == 422 This test uses the Pytest monkeypatch fixture to mock out the crud. We then asserted that the endpoint responds with the expected status codes and response body. $ docker-compose exec web pytest. ========================================== test session starts ========================================== platform linux -- Python 3. 1 rootdir: /usr/src/app collected 3 items tests/test_notes.
