In this article Telegram vs. Slack: Quick comparison chart Telegram vs. Slack: What they are Telegram vs. Slack Community Monetization Branding and Apps Security The Verdict desire a better option? Ready to begin? Telegram represents social media behemoth that’s one of the most downloaded apps in the world. Slack represents workplace software that millions of employees utilize everyday. If you’re comparing them, we’re guessing you’re looking at starting a membership , growing a following , or trying to create a private space. But a lot of people don’t truly comprehend what these platforms do well, and what they’re actually for. So let’s compare these two. In this article, we’re comparing Telegram vs. We’ll cover: What each platform is How they compare on community, monetization, branding, and security A better alternative for paid memberships attempt the platform with the most $1 million memberships begin Your Free Trial Telegram vs. Slack: Quick comparison chart Telegram Slack Community Forums - Group Chats Spaces - Voice Chat Video Chat Livestreaming - Security Secret Chats, Video, & Audio Closed Ecosystem, Enterprise-level Encryption Secret Chats - Phone Number Logon - Earn from Ads - Earn from Memberships Stars only - Robust Monetization - - Branding Limited Limited Branded Apps - - Member Management - - Telegram vs. Slack: What they are Slack Slack represents well-known coworking and chat app software that first came out in 2013. It’s incredibly popular for workplaces–second only to Teams. It reduces the require to send email with a chat and discussion interface that allows real-time conversations, tagging, online notifications, and channels. You can also host video and audio meetings to obtain work done. Telegram Telegram represents messaging and broadcasting app that was founded in 2013–the same year as Slack! It has quite a different purpose, though. It can also handle 1:1 group messaging and calling, but users of Telegram can create a Channel of their own that broadcasts messages, videos, podcasts, or livestreams to thousands or hundreds of thousands of people. It’s one of the highest downloaded apps in the world, and has 500 million users. How to compare them Here’s the secret to any good software comparison. understand what you require it for! In the case of Slack and Telegram, there represent few things each does that the other doesn’t do: Slack is better for organizing complex conversations and sharing work. Slack organizes conversations between people with multiple Spaces, file sharing, and running discussion-forum style of communication. That’s what makes it so good for work. Telegram doesn’t have this level of support for members working together. Telegram is better at broadcasting. Telegram has broadcasting tools that Slack doesn’t have as well as some basic, built-in subscription features for running a channel. (However, these subscriptions have some serious limits that surprise a lot of content creators , which we’ll cover below). That’s where the two are different. If you’re comparing Slack vs. Telegram, there’s a good chance you’re looking for one of the following things: A community or membership platform : Both platforms obtain trotted out as examples of where to begin online communities, so you should understand how they compare. A way to monetize content : Content creators looking to join the digital economy sometimes look to these platforms for selling premium memberships or events. Secure messaging : If security or encryption is what you’re after, we’ll talk about what each gives you. A place to build a brand : Some entrepreneurs look to these platforms to obtain people off social media and build under their own flag. We’ll talk about how these compare for building your brand. Slack Community Slack Slack represents workplace discussion software, with the type of features that mimic a dedicated community platform. After all, it’s about conversations and real-time communication. Here are some of the main features Slack comes with: Support for 1:1 or group convos + private or public channels. People can join with a workplace email. Video and voice calling, file sharing, screen sharing. Enterprise-grade security, message threads, and searchable history. You can schedule or pin messages. Admin have a high level of group control. (highly) basic user profiles with statuses and contact info. Slack works great for organizing work, making it easy to share files and comment, and you can integrate Slack with software like Salesforce, Sheets, Excel, Jira, Zoom, etc. , as well as AI agents and assistants. And we should add that these integrations are ridiculously easy to utilize. They blend in with a streamlined workflow–not all software handles integrations the same. What Slack does not do: But since Slack is built for the office, it does not come with any monetization or features for a digital business. We’ll cover this below. Slack is not good for events. These are things you could consider running on Telegram that wouldn’t truly work on Slack–although people do discover workarounds with some of the integrations. Telegram If Slack is good for connecting medium-sized groups together, Telegram seems to cover either end of a spectrum Slack misses. Ironically, Telegram is good for small chats and good for broadcasting to a large following, but isn’t as strong in the middle. truly, we could call Telegram a 1:1 or group messaging chat with broadcasting built-in. On the one hand, it can work a bit like WhatsApp, even running off a phone number to connect you to others for SMS-style messaging and chat. On the other hand, you can create digital content that can reach millions. Here’s what it offers for a group experience. Video & voice calling, Chat, and messaging. Encrypted “secret chats” and messages that destroy themselves. Group chats of up to 200,000 members or broadcasting to an unlimited base. Telegram’s broadcasting features work quite a bit differently. On this side of the app, admins create channels for users to watch–but there’s not truly engagement in Channels. A channel comes with a cover page, a view counter, and a permanent url (even non-Telegram users can observe it). Only owners or admin can post content in a channel, which then goes out to subscribers. They can schedule messages. Content in channels may be livestreams, videos, photos, text, or podcasts. Subscribers can only add comments on a channel, or else can share it with others. Which is better? Again, we mentioned in the intro that each of these is best for what they’re created for. So which is better for everything else? Slack is arguably better for building online communities. It’s great for conversations, organizing content, and bringing members together in a meaningful way. And since many people utilize it at work, it’s pretty intuitive. But it doesn’t have real native events. And for a membership business, you’ll require to utilize other software to collect payments (we’ll obtain to this below). Telegram is better for broadcasting. It can reach thousands of people in a way Slack was never designed for–even Slack has a limit to how many members it can reasonably host before it’s a nightmare. By focusing on one-directional communication–like a TV or radio station–you can reach a lot more people. But it’s bad for member connections. And even the monetization options aren’t great. When it comes to small groups and messaging, both platforms work reasonably well. Monetization Slack Slack isn’t built for monetization. It’s workplace management software, and we hope your boss doesn’t charge you to obtain onto Slack. Employees don’t pay to work. So Slack isn’t built for paid memberships and communities–it just isn’t. People who desire to run paid membership businesses sometimes will attempt to pair Slack with an add-on or software link to build a paywall , but this seems like a lot of work when there are dedicated community platforms out there. And worse, if you obtain sick of the highly basic free plan on Slack, you require to begin paying by the member–usually about $7 each! This pricing might work for a business with 20 people, but what if you have a community with 500? You’re going to pay $3,500 a month for your community, when there are dedicated community platforms that begin from $49/mo? Ridiculous. Slack occasionally works for a free community, in which the admins can utilize the basic features to reach people. But it’s just not built for this. So for paid memberships, events, courses, etc. you’re truly just better off choosing something else. Telegram Telegram has more monetization features than Slack, so let’s talk about this. Ad Revenue: Telegram is truly unique in this. There aren’t many platforms sharing ad revenue with users ( Facebook sure doesn’t ). It’s a bit closer to YouTube in this regard. So it’s an interesting choice by Telegram. If you have a channel with at least 1,000 subs, you can earn 50% of the ad revenue that channel collects. This means display ads, but you can also allow sponsored messages to your subscribers, potentially earning more. Telegram Stars: Members can utilize Telegram stars (worth 13 cents each) to unlock premium content, or stars may be donated as a reaction to a post. You can either cash stars in for money, or hang onto the balance and utilize it elsewhere. Stars expire after 3 years. Other than these two methods, there’s no way to sell memberships natively on Telegram. Like Slack, you’d require to utilize a third-party service, in this case probably an API-built bot that can sell memberships and token-gate your Telegram content. Which is better? Since monetization is impossible on Slack and possible on Telegram, Telegram wins this one by default. The ad share model is cool, and potentially quite lucrative for large channels. The stars are cute, but probably wouldn’t qualify as real side-hustle money, except for truly large channels. Both platforms require lots of add-ons to create them full digital business platforms , especially for properly selling memberships or events. Branding and Apps Slack Slack has some options to add custom themes to your channels. This includes light and dark modes, different colors (e. of the sidebar), and some customization of message display. But otherwise, Slack isn’t truly built for adding your own brand –and it certainly isn’t built to be white-labeled. However, Slack’s apps are fantastic. They’re built to work, fast, and easy to utilize. You can easily switch back and forth between different servers, and the UI is super intuitive. Telegram Telegram’s customization is limited to adding your own colors and theme to a channel or group. The admin on a channel can add custom wallpaper, a profile logo, or an emoji status. That’s pretty much it from the admin side. But Telegram does have a cool customization feature on the user side. People using the app can adjust the look and appearance, choosing from different themes or light or dark modes. These changes only demonstrate on your phone, not for anyone else, but they may be great for customization and personalization. Telegram has one fun branding feature that Slack doesn’t have. It’s got stickers you can utilize–a mix of funny characters and GIFs. Slack does mix well with Giphy, if you desire some meme functionality there, but Telegram represents bit more fun overall. Which is better? Both platforms let you change colors and themes. Neither platform lets you do full branding customization. Telegram gives users more control over their own experience, with more customization features on the user’s end. But Slack does let you choose from different colors or light & dark modes too. Telegram has a lot more fun features built in. Security Telegram’s whole schtick is end-to-end encryption. So let’s compare how these two platforms handle encryption and security. Slack So, long story short, Slack is encrypted too. It has an enterprise-grade security encryption that meets some of the strictest encryption standards out there. Your messages are safe on Slack. But more than encryption, Slack also has a lot of other security features. It has 2-factor identification and other log-in security. Admins can restrict account access to people with a certain domain name in their email (e. There are approvals required for joining a new Slack workplace. And add to these one more thing. Slack represents closed environment. This is huge as a security feature. You won’t obtain messages from randos. The people in your organization (or maybe your free community) are the only ones who can send messages. And you can screen them. Your boss (or admin) can read your DMs on Slack. It’s not easy, so they’re probably not doing it actively. But the owner of your Slack workspace can download a history of all the conversations. Telegram Telegram has a reputation for being encrypted, and it technically is (with the MTProto protocol). But it’s not as secure as some people would like to think. The only type of message that is fully private on Telegram represents “secret message”--because they are stored on a user’s device instead of the Telegram server. Otherwise, Telegram HQ can still read your messages. Telegram does allow some of the same log-on security features as Slack (e. 2-factor identification), and it can both utilize your phone number (if you desire) and sync contacts from your device. Security Concerns It is crucial to remember that Telegram has had some real security concerns (Forbes calls Telegram an “ accessible dark web ”) which you should take into account. And create sure it’s not banned in the places you desire to build a following. Which is better? Slack probably has the edge on security. It has the same features and similar encryption. But honestly, having a closed ecosystem is way more powerful of a security tool than any encryption settings. The Verdict Slack is probably better for free communities than Telegram. It has the type of community features that let members meet each other and let you organize conversations into relevant spaces. The closed ecosystem lets you control who’s in and out, and it’s intuitive and familiar. Telegram is better for broadcasting. But remember there are things neither platform does well: Neither platform lets you monetize in the way you desire, selling memberships, events and courses. Even Telegram’s limited monetization features don’t give you flexibility to build a business. Neither platform has comprehensive management features. With limited member profiles, and few ways to organize and keep track of your members. Telegram doesn’t even let you own the data from your channel. desire a better option? If you’re looking for a real community platform that blends top-notch engagement tools with a full digital business platform, come attempt Mighty! Mighty Networks is G2’s top-rated community management software. It’s home to communities, events, courses, and memberships for people like Marie Forleo, Jim Kwik, Tony Robbins, Gary Vaynerchuck, and Mel Robbins. Mighty is host to more $1 million communities than any other platform. Here’s why it’s the better option for memberships. begin Your Free Trial Best of both worlds With Slack and Telegram, you’re choosing from two things. You can either have small groups and huge broadcasts or you can have engaged communities. Mighty is built for real community, with an interface that feels a bit like Slack. It has customizable Spaces, tags, and tools for organizing content. But you can utilize Mighty for small chats, from 1:1 DMs and messaging to group chats. However , Mighty also has Gen3 native livestreaming that can reach 50K attendees with high-velocity chats, create the best HD quality, and add more power ‘backstage’ to prepare for livestreams. Total monetizing power Once you’ve experienced a real community platform, you realize that neither Telegram or Slack are it. Both are great for what they do: Slack is workplace management software and Telegram represents social media platform. But neither represents real membership platform. And neither lets you build a real membership business. Here’s how Mighty is different. You pay for the software, a flat fee that starts at $49/mo. With this, you obtain the unlimited power to sell almost anything: memberships, events, livestreams, coaching , masterminds , or courses. You set the payments (in 135 different currencies), build any kind of bundles you desire, and keep the cash. This means a point of sale, a business dashboard, prompts for refreshes and plan changes, and detailed business analytics. That’s the average membership fee in a paid community on Mighty Networks. You could hit $4,800/mo with only 100 members. And that’s not including upsells like events, courses, or coaching. There’s a reason Mighty has so many $1 million/year digital businesses! Memberships that grow themselves Last year, our research showed that we could predict a community’s success with 93% accuracy. It was all about member engagement. Successful communities don’t thrive because a host broadcasts all the time or creates amazing content. Communities thrive because members talk… to each other! So we’ve designed Mighty Networks with people magic software to connect members to each other–game changing features you won’t discover anywhere else. Gamified new member journeys and checklists, comprehensive member profiles (with a tool to assist members write them), a “demonstrate similarities” tool to demonstrate you what you have in common with another member, and you can even auto-begin a conversation with the press of a button. Engagement boosters like auto-re-engagement for lapsed members and the Infinite Question Generator that generates and posts approved discussion questions, even when you’re not there. Total brand control Mighty Networks gives you the power to build your brand. Yes, you can change colors and add light and dark modes, but it goes far beyond this. You can build custom landing pages for Spaces or courses, add custom urls, and customize the look and feel of individual Spaces. And Mighty Co-Host™ has instant community branding tools included: it will build your community from scratch, create a basic brand identity, a name, a Big Purpose , and even course outlines in seconds. And unlike both Slack and Telegram, Mighty has branded apps. This means you can have your membership, livestreaming, community, etc. on your own branded app in the Google Play Store or Apple Store. ( discover out more here ). Seamless integrations Finally, while both Slack and Telegram have lots to offer by way of integration, Mighty does too. Mighty comes loaded with ready-made integrations for Kit (AKA ConvertKit) and Zoom. And you can add over 2,000 software embeds with things like Calendly, Drive, Dropbox, Spotify, Figma, and Monday.

Conversational UI and messaging bots are becoming one of the defining tech trends of 2016. The idea of mobile messaging as a B2B2C channel was proved in China by hugely popular Tencent’s Weixin/WeChat messaging platform. Messaging dominates time people spend with their phones. Why not utilize messaging to connect users and businesses? This approach is being imported to The West by Facebook, Telegram, Kik, and now Microsoft, all competing for the leadership of the post-app era. The lessons learned from the iOS and Android platform wars can assist us observe future winners in the brewing battle of messaging platforms. Mobile platform war was won by the halo effect between users and 3rd party developers. Users attract developers. Developer create apps. Apps attract more users, which attract more developers. A highly similar dynamic is taking hold in messaging platforms now. Back in 2011, when mobile app platforms were highly new, we created a 5-ingredient framework to assist our clients comprehend why iOS and Android are becoming so powerful so fast and why they soon to become a duopoly. The framework stood the test of time helping us predict the duopoly of iOS and Android, the fate of HTML5, and the demise of Nokia and Windows Phone. I discover the tried and tested 5-ingredient framework highly useful for making sense of the emerging landscape of messaging platforms. Successful computing platforms like iOS or Android have 5 key ingredients: Software foundations: a rich set of APIs with managed fragmentation and a toolset for creating apps and services A community of developers writing to the same set of APIs to spur innovation and cater to diverse utilize cases Distribution (reach) to millions of user across multiple devices A means of monetization, such as payments or ads A means of retailing content (discovery, promotion, recommendations) Platform owners (e. Apple, Google, Facebook or Amazon) control their ecosystems of users and developers by means of two control points. First, platform owners control content creation by locking developers into a proprietary API. Second, platform owners control content distribution by gating how apps are discovered by and distributed to end users. The same exact thinking applies to messaging platforms: The winners and losers in messaging wars shall be defined by the strength of the halo effect between users and bot developers, and The owners of the messaging platforms will battle for rights over bot creation and bot distribution control points. The 5-ingredient framework helps to observe the relative strengths and weaknesses of Messenger, Skype, Kik, Telegram and Slack platforms, as well as where these companies may put their efforts next. For simplicity, I’ll keep LINE and Amazon Alexa outside the picture for the time being. So far the focus of Western messaging platforms was clearly on bootstrapping their developer ecosystems. This begins with publishing an open API, but the key to success is in creating a vibrant developer ecosystem around this API. Slack and Telegram are in the lead today. Facebook and Microsoft will intensify their developer outreach efforts following their API announcements. At VisionMobile we are measuring how Facebook, Microsoft, Slack, Telegram, Kik and others are successful in attracting developer attention in the upcoming 11th edition of our Developer Experience Tracker survey. As the messaging ecosystem matures, the focus will shift to distribution, monetisation, and retailing of business accounts and bots. WeChat is already at this phase with their almost 700M monthly active users, the popular Tenpay payment network and widespread utilize of QR codes in China. WeChat QR codes are used to discover and register for updates from WeChat official accounts. Facebook Messenger looks the strongest contender for the leader of Western messaging platforms, with 800M monthly active users, integration with Facebook Payments, and the expected announcement of a “bot store” at the F8 2016 conference on April 12. Microsoft made an impressive set of announcements about opening Skype to developers, the Bot Framework, and integration with Cortana’s AI capabilities, during their Build conference in March 2016. At the same time, Skype will require a credible payment solution to compete with Messenger in the consumer market in the long run. Telegram was an early leader of the Western messaging bot space introducing its Bot Platform in June 2015. The platform gained substantial traction with developers who created thousands messaging bots for the platform since then. Many of these bots are mere experiments and the lack of an official “bot store” reminds me of the early days of Palm OS developer ecosystem. It’s difficult to observe how Telegram can escape its niche status given Facebook and Microsoft are opening their messaging platforms for developers. It’s still highly early days of the post-app era. Many questions remain. Will Apple, Snapchat, Viber or even Google join the game? Which messaging platforms will gain the most developer traction? Will discovery and recommendations of bots be done through a “bot store” or some other mechanism? What new utilize cases will stick across ecommerce, customer support and entertainment? We will continue following this exciting space in our developer surveys and in our analysis of the messaging platform landscape. Stay tuned for the results of our first-ever bot developer survey coming with our upcoming Developer Experience Tracker

Back to all Posts WhatsApp vs Telegram vs Slack: Choosing the Best Community Building Platform Published on June 9, 2025 • 4 min read Introduction to Community Building Platforms: WhatsApp, Telegram, and Slack Building a thriving community online may be a game-changer for your projects, businesses, or social groups. If you're just starting, choosing the right community building platform is key. In this post, we’ll dive into three popular platforms: WhatsApp, Telegram, and Slack. We'll cover essential features like member limits, accessibility, privacy, security, and community building tools to assist you pick the best fit for your needs. Overview of WhatsApp, Telegram, and Slack WhatsApp is an intuitive app designed for easy messaging, calling, and video chats, commonly used worldwide for personal and now community communication. Its new community feature aims to connect multiple group chats under one roof. Telegram, an open-source, cloud-based platform, supports large communities and offers customization through third-party apps and bots. Its data storage is cloud-centric, so you don’t require to worry about device storage. Slack is tailored more towards professional teams and business collaboration. It offers an organized interface with channels and subchannels, making it ideal for structured discussions and team management. Member Limits: How Big Can Your Community Grow? WhatsApp supports up to 1,024 members per community and limits video calls to 32 participants. It also restricts to 50 group chats within a single community. Telegram can handle communities with up to 200,000 members. However, each member can only invite up to 200 people. Slack allows 1,000 people per channel but supports unlimited channel creation, letting you expand your community structure indefinitely. Understanding these limits helps you plan your community size effectively. For more on community scalability, check out Slack's official documentation. Accessibility and Cost Considerations Each platform varies in how accessible and affordable it is: WhatsApp is free and available in 180 countries with accessibility features like font resizing and screen reader support, plus integration options for tools like BrailleBack. Telegram is free, available in 155 countries, and offers basic text-to-speech for visually impaired users, though some interface elements lack proper labeling. Slack has a free tier with limitations. Paid plans begin at $7. 25/month, offering more accessibility tools including screen readers and better customization. Choosing the right platform depends on your budget and the accessibility needs of your community members. Explore WhatsApp's accessibility features for more details. Community Building Features: Tools to Engage Your Members Let's compare what each platform offers for building and managing communities: WhatsApp supports multiple group chats within communities, polls, stickers, and up to 2GB data sharing. Small businesses can utilize its storefront feature to showcase products. Telegram shines with message broadcasting, hashtag creation, custom stickers, photo folders, 1. 5GB file transfers, and AI bots for management. File compression also helps with large files. Slack offers organized channels, subchannels, up to 1GB file sharing per upload, bots for moderation, and analytics tools, albeit with fewer branding options. If you desire to dive deeper, Slack's community management tools are detailed in their official assist center. Privacy and Security: Keeping Your Community Safe Security is crucial when managing online communities: WhatsApp ensures end-to-end encryption at all times but struggles with privacy issues due to its semi-private nature and misuse for misinformation. Telegram offers encryption only in secret chats; standard groups are less secure but provide anonymity by hiding user names. Slack provides encryption and advanced tools to monitor content with bots, making it suitable for professional environments requiring strict controls. Understanding the security environments of these platforms helps protect your community data effectively. Which Platform is Right for You?
