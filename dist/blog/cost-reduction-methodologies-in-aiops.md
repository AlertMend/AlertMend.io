While DevOps focuses on collaboration between development and operations teams to accelerate software delivery, AIOps integrates artificial intelligence to enhance monitoring, automation, and predictive capabilities. Various industry analyses have explored the similarities and differences between the two approaches, including discussions on how organizations can combine them to improve incident management and resource optimization. [ 21 ] Results [ edit ] AI optimizes IT operations in five ways: First, intelligent monitoring powered by AI helps identify potential issues before they cause outages, improving metrics like Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) by 15-20%.
Second, performance data analysis and insights enable quick decision-making by ingesting and analyzing large data sets in real time. Third, AI-driven automated infrastructure optimization efficiently allocates resources and thereby reducing cloud costs. Fourth, enhanced IT service management reduces critical incidents by over 50% through AI-driven end-to-end service management. Lastly, intelligent task automation accelerates problem resolution and automates remedial actions with minimal human intervention.
[ 22 ] In 2025, Atera Networks was identified as a leader in AIOps by the software review platform G2. MLOps [ edit ] AIOps tools utilize big data analytics, machine learning algorithms, and predictive analytics to detect anomalies, correlate events, and provide proactive insights. This automation reduces the burden on IT teams, allowing them to focus on strategic tasks rather than routine operational issues. AIOps is widely used by IT operations teams, DevOps , network administrators, and IT service management (ITSM) teams to enhance visibility and enable quicker incident resolution in hybrid cloud environments, data centers, and other IT infrastructures.
[ 24 ] [ 25 ] In contrast to MLOps (Machine Learning Operations), which focuses on the lifecycle management and operational aspects of machine learning models, AIOps focuses on optimizing IT operations using a variety of analytics and AI-driven techniques. While both disciplines rely on AI and data-driven methods, AIOps primarily targets IT operations, whereas MLOps is concerned with the deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of ML models.

Introduction The domain of IT operations is present process continuous evolution, and the appearance of Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) signifies a pivotal shift in how corporations manipulate and create utilize of era. AIOps, a combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and IT operations, revolutionizes the traditional IT management landscape. AI, characterized by the useful resource of the integration of system intelligence into numerous tactics, synchronizes with IT operations, which embody a huge range of duties associated with tracking and safety [ 1 ].
Consistent with Datadog, AIOps leverages huge statistics and gadget learning to automate IT operations procedures, together with occasion correlation, anomaly detection, and causality dedication. In step with Gartner using actual-time statistics streams from IT infrastructure, this AI-pushed, multi-layered IT control platform automates information processing and decision-making. As a result, IT engineers can rely on gadget mastering algorithms to address the complex mission of occasion tracking and control, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and decreasing manual intervention [ 2 ] (observe Fig.
1 ) Major statistics serve because the foundational element of AIOps is offering the full-size and numerous datasets crucial for producing insights and predictions. Those datasets contain log files, events, and software program performance metrics, offering a holistic view of the IT environment. Historically, IT operations were disordered, with multiple servers and contrasting structures operating in silos. These surroundings were similarly complicated by means of guide procedures, a reactive technique to incident response, and a lack of unified visibility all through various data assets.
The developing complexity of contemporary IT infrastructures, marked by isolated information silos and identity no longer on time trouble, made it tough for IT agencies to preserve up. The emerging adoption of AIOps is driven by major business benefits and increasing the enterprise demand in cloud. [ 22 ] In any organization visibility across operations represent basic and core principle of modern AIOps solutions [ 24 ]. When we think about adoption of AIOps which is relies heavily on big data technologies to process and analyze using huge amount of datasets [ 25 ].
The demanding situations of conventional IT operations required a reevaluation of methods. Among those demanding situations, artificial intelligence for IT operations (AIOps) emerged as a game-changer. AIOps monitoring is now completely restructuring the organizations looking into IT System Performance [ 28 ]. AIOps brings order to chaos through offering unified visibility, automating techniques, and intelligently coping with complexities and effective IT operations with faster solutions [ 30 ].
The Difference between observability and monitoring is crucial in modern systems so industry solutions now implementing this within months of matter along with AIOps capabilities. Machine Learning along with predictive analytics are the core part of evolution in AIOps platform [ 20 ]. Gradient boosting which is well known algorithm such as XGBoost become highly popular for handling such kind of complex predictive tasks in AIOps [ 19 ][ 23 ]. Different Monitoring solutions like Datadog, instana,operations bridge are core part to current IT management strategies.
[ 27 ] In AIOps implementations there are some techniques such as a linear regression which is widely used for predictive modeling in AIOps implementation [ 29 ][ 31 ].
Maximize the impact and value now day organizations are using strategic approaches some system level approaches in dynamic environments [ 26 ][ 32 ]. A timeline as depicted in (as per Fig. 2 ) shall be used to summarize the thrilling journey that AIOps has taken in its evolution [ 6 ] 2010–2015: The rise of big data and analytics allowed organizations to build up and examine huge volumes of operational information. For the duration of this period, superior analytics started out to be carried out in IT operations, allowing extra experienced choice-making [ 4 ].
2010–2015: The upward push of huge facts and analytics allowed companies to build up and analyze big volumes of operational records. During this period, advanced analytics began to be applied in IT operations, permitting greater experienced selection-making [ 5 ]. 2016: The period "AIOps" gained popularity, marking a shift towards the adoption of AI-pushed operations. The emergence of AIOps offerings and service companies made those eras more accessible and scalable.
2017: Early adopters of AIOps started to experience its benefits firsthand, demonstrating its functionality to enhance carrier delivery and optimize overall operational performance. 2018–2019: AIOps gained a lot of momentum as providers started out providing answers that covered machine learning algorithms for task automation and actual-time insights, at the side of occasion correlation, log evaluation, and incident control. 2020–2023: AIOps solutions matured similarly, incorporating superior features like root motive evaluation, predictive analytics, and nearer integration with DevOps practices.
These improvements allowed IT teams to proactively address problems, optimize resource utilization, and create records-pushed alternatives [ 6 ]. 2021-Today: Inside the cutting-edge generation, AIOps has superior rights to a complicated accomplice for IT groups, going beyond simple automation. Current AIOps answers offer proactive anomaly detection, predictive automation, and comprehensive facts-pushed insights, allowing IT professionals to save you from problems before they stand up and create sure of green operations [ 7 ].
1 Key components of AIOps AIOps has evolved from its early stages to become a strategic best buddy for IT organizations. To comprehend its transforming power, a closer look at its inner workings is required. At the heart of AIOps represents complex engine room fueled by critical additives. The increase in data volume, particularly in large, unstructured data lake systems, represents significant challenge for AIOps teams. The key statistics property consists of logs, metrics, traces, and events (observe Fig.
Logs are written messages created by servers, apps, and other computer components. They provide details on events, movements, mistakes, and alerts. Logs are useful for discovering anomalies,
## Debugging
## Understanding
: While much research offers strategies to improve alert correlation and anomaly identification, there may be a lack of practical studies directly evaluating their impact on MTTR reduction. Future studies must include clear measurements and case studies that demonstrate MTTR improvements.
Real-Time Processing and Scalability: Frameworks are often evaluated in controlled situations or with restricted datasets. Real-time processing capabilities and scalability of AIOps solutions across immense, complex IT infrastructures should be the focus of future research. 4 Data Quality Issues with a Starting AIOps relies heavily on data from a variety of sources, including metrics, events, traces, and logs. It is challenging to ensure the quality and consistency of this data across sizes and formats.
Data accuracy is critical to the success of AI-driven insights and decision-making. Incomplete or faulty data might lead to erroneous conclusions and actions. In data integration, a significant amount of work is required to integrate data from diverse sources (cloud environments, legacy systems, and other tools) into a unified framework suitable for AI research. Integration complexities (observe Fig. 4 ) in IT settings typically include a mix of legacy systems, hybrid cloud infrastructures, and additional technologies.
Integrating data from different dissimilar sources into a unified AIOps platform may be difficult; hence, strong integration frameworks and protocols are required. The existing IT operations technologies that must be linked with AIOps include monitoring systems, incident management systems, and ticketing systems. Keeping current procedures operational while assuring smooth integration and interoperability may be difficult. API compatibility for incompatible APIs across different tools and platforms may limit smooth automation and data flow.
Skilled personnel with AI/ML technology and IT operations skills are required for deploying and managing AIOps systems. These professionals must be familiar with the nuances of AI model implementation, data processing, and IT architecture. Data Science and AI Expertise for Effective AIOps Implementation requires
## Understanding
: text similarity (0. 4), topology relationship (0. 3), and time proximity (0. Pairwise similarity scores are computed as follows: Text Similarity: Calculate cosine similarity text_sim(ai,aj).
between the text descriptions of alerts ai and aj. Topology Relationship: Assign a score of 1 if alerts originate from connected services; otherwise, 0 topology(ai,aj). Time Proximity: Assign a score of 1 if alerts occur within a defined time window, otherwise 0 time_prox(ai,aj) The overall similarity score S(ai,aj) between two alerts is calculated using the formula: $$\:S(ai\text{},aj\text{})=0. 4\times\:text\_sim(ai\text{},aj\text{})+0. 3\times\:topology(ai\text{},aj\text{})+0.
3\times\:time\_prox(ai\text{},aj\text{})$$ Using these similarity scores, the algorithm constructs similarity graphs Gl for each criterion, where nodes represent alerts and edges connect pairs of alerts (ai,aj)with similarity scores above a threshold T. Graph traversal algorithms are then used to identify connected components within each similarity graph Gl​, demonstrating clusters of related alerts. The algorithm then groups all similarity graphs (observe Fig.
7 ) into a single combined graph G by integrating the individual graphs and adding edges between alerts if they belong to the same connected component in any Gl​. The final clusters of related alerts are identified by navigating the combined graph G. For each identified cluster, the algorithm creates an AIOps incident, containing crucial details such as impacted services, severity, and an outlier type. These incidents are prioritized based on factors like severity, impact, and the number of correlated alerts.
By automating the correlation of alerts and the group of incidents, this algorithm significantly reduces the time required to identify and respond to issues and helps in decreasing the Mean Time to Identify (MTTI). For data collection, we leveraged various tools to ensure comprehensive data gathering and investigation. Monitoring systems like Datadog are used to accumulate real-time alert data, providing crucial insights into application, infrastructure, and service performance.
The log aggregation tool Datadog is used to compile log data from specific sources, enabling preprocessing and subsequent analysis. In terms of data analysis, Python libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-learn play an essential role. Scikit-learn is essential for computing text similarity. For implementation, Python is the chosen programming language to develop the custom algorithm. Machine learning models are integrated to calculate text similarity and perform predictive analytics, enhancing the overall effectiveness of the solution.
The unique algorithm's performance is evaluated and validated using 420 days of previous alert statistics. Overall performance indicators, including accuracy and F1-score, are used to evaluate its success because it should cluster similar alarms and produce actionable issues. The assessment impacts demonstrate the set of rules' capacity to reduce noise and false positives, resulting in faster incident resolution and improved operational performance.
Results Before beginning the analysis, it is critical to ensure data preparation and cleaning. This includes verifying data quality by looking for missing values, ensuring correct data types, and ensuring that all relevant features, such as start_time, end_time, and severity, are properly formatted. Furthermore, derived metrics such as mean time to identify (MTTI), mean time to resolve (MTTR), anomaly detection counts, and resource utilization should be computed.
For performance metrics, the mean time to identify (MTTI) is computed for incidents detected by the algorithm. This metric is then compared to historical baselines or between environments, such as production and staging. A lower MTTI indicates that the algorithm is effective at quickly detecting incidents, which is critical for minimizing downtime. Similarly, the Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) is used to assess the time it takes to resolve an incident. By comparing MTTR before and after the algorithm's implementation, it is possible to determine whether the algorithm not only identifies incidents faster but also helps to resolve them faster.
Incident detection accuracy is another key metric, where true positives (TP), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN) are used to calculate precision and recall. Precision is given by the formula below, and it indicates the accuracy of incident detection. $$\:Precision=TP/(TP+FP)$$ Recall is calculated as the formula below, which measures the algorithm's ability to detect all incidents. $$\:Recall=TP/(TP+FN)$$ The F1 Score, a combined metric of precision and recall, is determined by $$\:F1\:Score=2\times\:(Precision+Recall)/2\times\:(Precision\times\:Recall)$$ High precision and recall values indicate a strong algorithm (shown in Fig.
10 ), whereas lower scores may indicate that more tuning is required. In severity and impact analysis, it is critical to consider how the algorithm handles incidents of varying severity, particularly whether it correctly prioritizes higher severity incidents. Furthermore, an impact analysis should be performed to quantify the impact of incidents identified by the algorithm, such as downtime or the number of affected users. An effective algorithm should prioritize incidents with a higher impact, and it is critical to assess whether the alert severity is correctly correlated with the actual impact.
For anomaly detection and clustering, the algorithm's detected anomalies should be analyzed to determine their significance. If the algorithm is overly sensitive, it may generate numerous false positives. Effective clustering should group related alerts to reduce noise and focus on true incidents. The quality of clustering is determined by whether it successfully combines related alerts, thereby reducing the cognitive load on the operations team. Resource utilization evaluates the algorithm's efficiency in terms of CPU, memory, and I/O usage.
These metrics should be compared across environments and to performance baselines. Furthermore, the algorithm's scalability is evaluated by measuring its performance as data volumes increase. An efficient algorithm should maintain performance while avoiding resource bottlenecks. Environment-specific analysis compares the algorithm's performance in various environments such as production, staging, and development. Production environments typically contain more complex and noisy data, which makes the algorithm more difficult to solve.
An effective algorithm should perform consistently across environments, with a focus on how it handles complex production data. Trend analysis looks at how the algorithm's performance changes over time, particularly trends in MTTI, MTTR, and the number of incidents detected. Seasonal variations, such as an increase in incidents at certain times (e. , the end of the month in Fig. 8 ), should also be noted. Trend analysis can assist identify periods of instability or areas where the algorithm needs to be adjusted.
Root cause analysis assesses how well the algorithm detects the underlying causes of incidents. The algorithm's effectiveness is measured by its ability to accurately trace incidents back to their source while avoiding frequent misidentifications. Detailed reports should be generated to document the algorithm's reasoning for each detected incident to validate its performance. High accuracy in root cause analysis is critical for reducing MTTR where we require to comprehend which kind of anomalies are there with the different alert type (shown in Fig.
9 ) and improving overall system reliability. Visualizations are crucial in data analysis, including the utilize of heatmaps to visualize incident frequency and severity across different time periods or environments, scatter plots to visualize the relationship between MTTI and MTTR for different incident types or environments, and histograms and bar charts to compare incident distribution by severity, environment, or time. Network graphs can also be used to visualize alert clusters and their connections, which can aid in the identification of incident propagation patterns.
Finally, continuous improvement is achieved by establishing a feedback loop in which human analysts evaluate the algorithm's performance and propose improvements. This analysis informs algorithm tuning, which entails adjusting parameters such as weights for similarity criteria or thresholds for anomaly detection to improve accuracy and efficiency. Regular updates and tuning ensure that the algorithm adapts to changing conditions and continues to perform well.
Conclusion The custom algorithm developed for AIOps incident management has demonstrated extremely positive improvements in operational efficiency and incident response. The set of rules significantly reduces the implied time to perceive (MTTI) incidents by utilizing real-time information collection, the Datadog APM device, effective preprocessing with normalization and characteristic extraction, and accurate alert correlation leveraging more than one standard.
The utilize of graph algorithms and device mastering models improves precision and alert clustering, resulting in a 45% reduction in MTTI from 60 to 33 minutes. Furthermore, the set of rules received high precision (0. 92) ratings, indicating its efficacy in efficiently identifying and correlating related signs. The creation and implementation of a custom set of rules for AIOps incident control represents a significant advancement in IT operational efficiency.
The set of rules provides a robust strategy to the annoying situations of well-timed and correct incident identification by leveraging real-time data series, modern preprocessing strategies, and advanced correlation algorithms. The significant reduction in MTTI and high accuracy metrics demonstrate the set of rules ability to transform IT incident control practices. Moving forward, ongoing refinement and variation of the set of guidelines may be required to deal with changing IT landscapes and ensure sustained improvements in incident management and modern operational resilience.

As Mark mentioned when he authored the Advancing Reliability blog series, building and operating a global cloud infrastructure at the scale of Azure represents complex task with hundreds of ever-evolving service components, spanning more than 160 datacenters and across more than 60 regions.
“In the era of big data, insights collected from cloud services running at the scale of Azure quickly exceed the attention span of humans. It’s critical to identify the right steps to maintain the highest possible quality of service based on the large volume of data collected.
In applying this to Azure, we envision infusing AI into our cloud platform and DevOps process, becoming AIOps, to enable the Azure platform to become more self-adaptive, resilient, and efficient. AIOps will also support our engineers to take the right actions more effectively and in a timely manner to continue improving service quality and delighting our customers and partners. This post continues our Advancing Reliability series highlighting initiatives underway to keep improving the reliability of the Azure platform.
The post that follows was written by Jian Zhang , our Program Manager overseeing these efforts, as she shares our vision for AIOps, and highlights areas of this AI infusion that are already a reality as part of our end-to-end cloud service management. ”—Mark Russinovich, CTO, Azure This post includes contributions from Principal Data Scientist Manager Yingnong Dang and Partner Group Software Engineering Manager Murali Chintalapati. As Mark mentioned when he launched this Advancing Reliability blog series, building and operating a global cloud infrastructure at the scale of Azure represents complex task with hundreds of ever-evolving service components, spanning more than 160 datacenters and across more than 60 regions.
To rise to this challenge, we have created an AIOps team to collaborate broadly across Azure engineering teams and partnered with Microsoft Research to develop AI solutions to create cloud service management more efficient and more reliable than ever before. We are going to share our vision on the importance of infusing AI into our cloud platform and DevOps process. Gartner referred to something similar as AIOps (pronounced “AI Ops”) and this has become the common term that we utilize internally, albeit with a larger scope.
Today’s post is just the begin, as we intend to provide regular updates to share our adoption stories of using AI technologies to support how we build and operate Azure at scale. There are two unique characteristics of cloud services: The ever-increasing scale and complexity of the cloud platform and systems The ever-changing needs of customers, partners, and their workloads To build and operate reliable cloud services during this constant state of flux, and to do so as efficiently and effectively as possible, our cloud engineers (including thousands of Azure developers, operations engineers, customer support engineers, and program managers) heavily rely on data to create decisions and take actions.
Furthermore, many of these decisions and actions require to be executed automatically as an integral part of our cloud services or our DevOps processes. Streamlining the path from data to decisions to actions involves identifying patterns in the data, reasoning, and making predictions based on historical data, then recommending or even taking actions based on the insights derived from all that underlying data.
Infusing AI into cloud platform and DevOps. The AIOps vision AIOps has started to transform the cloud business by improving service quality and customer experience at scale while boosting engineers’ productivity with intelligent tools, driving continuous cost optimization, and ultimately improving the reliability, performance, and efficiency of the platform itself. When we invest in advancing AIOps and related technologies, we observe this ultimately provides value in several ways: Higher service quality and efficiency : Cloud services will have built-in capabilities of self-monitoring, self-adapting, and self-healing, all with minimal human intervention.
Platform-level automation powered by such intelligence will improve service quality (including reliability, and availability, and performance), and service efficiency to deliver the best possible customer experience. Higher DevOps productivity : With the automation power of AI and ML, engineers are released from the toil of investigating repeated issues, manually operating and supporting their services, and can instead focus on solving new problems, building new functionality, and work that more directly impacts the customer and partner experience.
In practice, AIOps empowers developers and engineers with insights to avoid looking at raw data, thereby improving engineer productivity. Higher customer satisfaction : AIOps solutions play a critical role in enabling customers to utilize, maintain, and troubleshoot their workloads on top of our cloud services as easily as possible. We endeavor to utilize AIOps to comprehend customer needs better, in some cases to identify potential pain points and proactively reach out as needed.
Data-driven insights into customer workload behavior could flag when Microsoft or the customer needs to take action to prevent issues or apply workarounds.
Ultimately, the goal is to improve satisfaction by quickly identifying, mitigating, and fixing issues. My colleagues Marcus Fontoura, Murali Chintalapati, and Yingnong Dang shared Microsoft’s vision, investments, and sample achievements in this space during the keynote AI for Cloud–Toward Intelligent Cloud Platforms and AIOps at the AAAI-20 Workshop on Cloud Intelligence in conjunction with the 34th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. The vision was created by a Microsoft AIOps committee across cloud service product groups including Azure, Microsoft 365, Bing, and LinkedIn, as well as Microsoft Research (MSR).
In the keynote, we shared a few key areas in which AIOps may be transformative for building and operating cloud systems, as shown in the chart below. AI for Cloud: AIOps and AI-Serving Platform. AIOps Moving beyond our vision, we wanted to begin by briefly summarizing our general methodology for building AIOps solutions. A solution in this space always starts with data—measurements of systems, customers, and processes—as the key of any AIOps solution is distilling insights about system behavior, customer behaviors, and DevOps artifacts and processes.
The insights could include identifying a problem that is happening now (detect), why it’s happening (diagnose), what will happen in the future (predict), and how to improve (optimize, adjust, and mitigate). Such insights should always be associated with business metrics—customer satisfaction, system quality, and DevOps productivity—and drive actions in line with prioritization determined by the business impact. The actions will also be fed back into the system and process.
This feedback could be fully automated (infused into the system) or with humans in the loop (infused into the DevOps process). This overall methodology guided us to build AIOps solutions in three pillars. AIOps methodologies: Data, insights, and actions. AI for systems Today, we’re introducing several AIOps solutions that are already in utilize and supporting Azure behind the scenes. The goal is to automate system management to reduce human intervention.
As a result, this helps to reduce operational costs, improve system efficiency, and increase customer satisfaction. These solutions have already contributed significantly to the Azure platform availability improvements, especially for Azure IaaS virtual machines (VMs). AIOps solutions contributed in several ways including protecting customers’ workload from host failures through hardware failure prediction and proactive actions like live migration and Project Tardigrade and pre-provisioning VMs to shorten VM creation time.
Of course, engineering improvements and ongoing system innovation also play crucial roles in the continuous improvement of platform reliability. Hardware Failure Prediction is to protect cloud customers from interruptions caused by hardware failures. We shared our story of Improving Azure Virtual Machine resiliency with predictive ML and live migration back in 2018. Microsoft Research and Azure have built a disk failure prediction solution for Azure Compute, triggering the live migration of customer VMs from predicted-to-fail nodes to healthy nodes.
We also expanded the prediction to other types of hardware issues including memory and networking router failures. This enables us to perform predictive maintenance for better availability. Pre-Provisioning Service in Azure brings VM deployment reliability and latency benefits by creating pre-provisioned VMs. Pre-provisioned VMs are pre-created and partially configured VMs ahead of customer requests for VMs. As we described in the AAAI-20 keynote mentioned above, the Pre-Provisioning Service leverages a prediction engine to predict VM configurations and the number of VMs per configuration to pre-create.
This prediction engine applies dynamic models that are trained based on historical and current deployment behaviors and predicts future deployments.
Pre-Provisioning Service uses this prediction to create and manage VM pools per VM configuration. Pre-Provisioning Service resizes the pool of VMs by destroying or adding VMs as prescribed by the latest predictions. Once a VM matching the customer’s request is identified, the VM is assigned from the pre-created pool to the customer’s subscription. AI for DevOps AI can boost engineering productivity and assist in shipping high-quality services with speed.
Below represent few examples of AI for DevOps solutions. Incident management is an crucial aspect of cloud service management—identifying and mitigating rare but inevitable platform outages. A typical incident management procedure consists of multiple stages including detection, engagement, and mitigation stages. Time spent in each stage is used as a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) to measure and drive rapid issue resolution. KPIs include time to detect (TTD), time to engage (TTE), and time to mitigate (TTM).
Incident management procedures. As shared in AIOps Innovations in Incident Management for Cloud Services at the AAAI-20 conference, we have developed AI-based solutions that enable engineers not only to detect issues early but also to identify the right team(s) to engage and therefore mitigate as quickly as possible.
Tight integration into the platform enables end-to-end touchless mitigation for some scenarios, which considerably reduces customer impact and therefore improves the overall customer experience.
Anomaly Detection provides an end-to-end monitoring and anomaly detection solution for Azure IaaS. The detection solution targets a broad spectrum of anomaly patterns that includes not only generic patterns defined by thresholds, but also patterns which are typically more difficult to detect such as leaking patterns (for example, memory leaks) and emerging patterns (not a spike, but increasing with fluctuations over a longer term).
Insights generated by the anomaly detection solutions are injected into the existing Azure DevOps platform and processes, for example, alerting through the telemetry platform, incident management platform, and, in some cases, triggering automated communications to impacted customers.
This helps us detect issues as early as possible. For an example that has already made its way into a customer-facing feature, Dynamic Threshold is an ML-based anomaly detection model. It represents feature of Azure Monitor used through the Azure portal or through the ARM API. Dynamic Threshold allows users to tune their detection sensitivity, including specifying how many violation points will trigger a monitoring alert. Safe Deployment serves as an intelligent global “watchdog” for the safe rollout of Azure infrastructure components.
We built a system, code name Gandalf, that analyzes temporal and spatial correlation to capture latent issues that happened hours or even days after the rollout. This helps to identify suspicious rollouts (during a sea of ongoing rollouts), which is common for Azure scenarios, and helps prevent the issue propagating and therefore prevents impact to additional customers.
We provided details on our safe deployment practices in this earlier blog post and went into more detail about how Gandalf works in our USENIX NSDI 2020 paper and slide deck. AI for customers To improve the Azure customer experience, we were developing AI solutions to power the full lifecycle of customer management. For example, a decision support system was developed to guide customers towards the best selection of support resources by leveraging the customer’s service selection and verbatim summary of the problem experienced.
This helps shorten the time it takes to obtain customers and partners the right guidance and support that they require. AI-serving platform To achieve greater efficiencies in managing a global-scale cloud, we were investing in building systems that support using AI to optimize cloud resource usage and therefore the customer experience.
One example is Resource Central (RC) , an AI-serving platform for Azure that we described in Communications of the ACM. It collects telemetry from Azure containers and servers, learns from their prior behaviors, and, when requested, produces predictions of their future behaviors. We are already using RC to predict many characteristics of Azure Compute workloads accurately, including resource procurement and allocation, all of which helps to improve system performance and efficiency.
Looking towards the future We have shared our vision of AI infusion into the Azure platform and our DevOps processes and highlighted several solutions that are already in utilize to improve service quality across a range of areas. Look to us to share more details of our internal AI and ML solutions for even more intelligent cloud management in the future. We’re confident that these are the right investment solutions to improve our effectiveness and efficiency as a cloud provider, including improving the reliability and performance of the Azure platform itself

MLOps: Harnessing big data for “smarter” ITOPs Author Chrystal R.
China Staff Writer, Automation & ITOps IBM Think Digital data has exploded in recent decades. Driven by significant advancements in computing technology, everything from mobile phones to smart appliances to mass transit systems generate and digest data, creating a big data landscape that forward-thinking enterprises can leverage to drive innovation. However, the big data landscape is just that.
Wearable devices (such as fitness trackers, smart watches and smart rings) alone generated roughly 28 petabytes (28 billion megabytes) of data daily in 2020. And in 2024, global daily data generation surpassed 402 million terabytes (or 402 quintillion bytes). As IT environments become more complex—with the adoption of cloud services and the utilize of hybrid environments, microservices architectures and increasingly integrated systems, DevOps practices and other digital transformation technologies—traditional IT operations (ITOps) management tools often struggle to keep pace with the demands of ever-increasing data generation.
Instead, businesses tend to rely on advanced tools and strategies—namely artificial intelligence for IT operations (AIOps) and machine learning operations (MLOps)—to turn vast quantities of data into actionable insights that can improve IT decision-making and ultimately, the bottom line. AIOps and MLOps: What’s the difference? AIOPs refers to the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance and automate various aspects of IT operations (ITOps).
AI technology enables computing devices to mimic the cognitive functions typically associated with human minds (learning, perceiving, reasoning and problem solving, for instance). And machine learning —a subset of AI—refers to a broad set of techniques for training a computer to learn from its inputs using existing data and one or more “training” methods (instead of being explicitly programmed). ML technologies assist computers achieve artificial intelligence.
Consequently, AIOps is designed to harness data and insight generation capabilities to assist organizations manage increasingly complex IT stacks. MLOps represents set of practices that combines machine learning (ML) with traditional data engineering and DevOps to create an assembly line for building and running reliable, scalable, efficient ML models. It helps companies streamline and automate the end-to-end ML lifecycle, which includes data collection, model creation (built on data sources from the software development lifecycle), model deployment, model orchestration, health monitoring and data governance processes.
MLOps helps ensure that everyone involved—from data scientists to software engineers and IT personnel—can collaborate and continuously monitor and improve models to maximize their accuracy and performance. Both AIOps and MLOps are pivotal practices for today’s enterprises; each one addresses distinct yet complementary ITOps needs. However, they differ fundamentally in their purpose and level of specialization in AI and ML environments.
Whereas AIOps represents comprehensive discipline that includes a variety of analytics and AI initiatives that are aimed at optimizing IT operations, MLOps is specifically concerned with the operational aspects of ML models, promoting efficient deployment, monitoring and maintenance. Here, we’ll discuss the key differences between AIOps and MLOps and how they each assist teams and businesses address different IT and data science challenges. MLOps and AIOps in practice AIOps and MLOps methodologies share some commonalities due to their roots in AI, but they serve distinct purposes, operate in different contexts and otherwise differ in several key ways.
Scope and focus AIOps methodologies are fundamentally geared toward enhancing and automating IT operations. Their primary objective is to optimize and streamline IT operations workflows by using AI to analyze and interpret vast quantities of data from various IT systems. AIOps processes harness big data to facilitate predictive analytics , automate responses and insight generation and ultimately, optimize the performance of enterprise IT environments.
In contrast, MLOps focuses on lifecycle management for ML models , including everything from model development and training to deployment, monitoring and maintenance. MLOps aims to bridge the gap between data science and operational teams so they can reliably and efficiently transition ML models from development to production environments, all while maintaining high model performance and accuracy. Data characteristics and preprocessing AIOps tools handle a range of data sources and types, including system logs, performance metrics, network data and application events.
However, data preprocessing in AIOps is often a complex process, involving: Advanced data cleaning procedures to handle noisy, incomplete and unstructured data Transformation techniques to convert disparate data formats into a unified structure so data is uniform and ready for analysis Integration methods to combine data from different IT systems and applications and provide a holistic view MLOps focuses on structured and semi-structured data (feature sets and labeled datasets) and uses preprocessing methods directly relevant to ML tasks, including: Feature engineering to create meaningful input variables from raw data Normalization and scaling techniques to prepare data for model training Data augmentation methods to enhance training datasets, especially for tasks like image processing 3.
Primary activities AIOps relies on big data-driven analytics , ML algorithms and other AI-driven techniques to continuously track and analyze ITOps data. The process includes activities such as anomaly detection, event correlation, predictive analytics, automated root cause analysis and natural language processing (NLP). AIOps also integrates with IT service management (ITSM) tools to provide proactive and reactive operational insights. MLOps involves a series of steps that assist ensure the seamless deployability, reproducibility, scalability and observability of ML models.
It includes a range of technologies—including machine learning frameworks, data pipelines, continuous integration / continuous deployment (CI/CD) systems, performance monitoring tools, version control systems and sometimes containerization tools (such as Kubernetes )—that optimize the ML lifecycle. Model development and deployment AIOps platforms develop a wide range of analytical models, including—but not limited to—machine learning. These can include statistical models ( regression analysis , for instance), rule-based systems and complex event processing models.
AIOps integrates these models into existing IT systems to enhance their functions and performance. MLOps prioritizes end-to-end management of machine learning models, encompassing data preparation, model training, hyperparameter tuning and validation. It uses CI/CD pipelines to automate predictive maintenance and model deployment processes, and focuses on updating and retraining models as new data becomes available. Primary users and stakeholders The primary users of AIOps technologies are IT operations teams, network administrators, DevOps and data operations (DataOps) professionals and ITSM teams, all of which benefit from the enhanced visibility, proactive issue detection and prompt incident resolution that AIOps offers.
MLOps platforms are primarily used by data scientists, ML engineers, DevOps teams and ITOps personnel who utilize them to automate and optimize ML models and obtain value from AI initiatives faster. Monitoring and feedback loops AIOps solutions focus on monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs)—such as system uptime, response time and error rates—across IT operations and incorporating user feedback to iterate and refine analytical models and services.
The real-time monitoring and alerting systems within AIOps technologies enable IT teams to identify and resolve IT issues quickly. MLOps monitoring requires teams to continuously track metrics such as model accuracy (correctness), precision (consistency), recall (memory) and data drift (external factors that degrade models over time). Based on those metrics, MLOps technologies continuously update ML models to correct performance issues and incorporate changes in data patterns.
utilize cases and benefits AIOps helps businesses increase operational efficiency and reduce operational costs by automating routine tasks that would typically require a human worker. This automation helps free up IT staff to focus on more strategic AI initiatives (instead of repetitive maintenance tasks). It also accelerates incident management by harnessing predictive analytics and automating the remediation process, enabling AIOps systems to discover and fix issues before they cause unexpected downtime or affect the user experience.
Given their ability to break down silos and foster collaboration between different teams and systems, AIOps solutions are frequently used by IT departments to manage a company’s data centers and cloud environments. AIOPs enables ITOPs personnel to implement predictive alert handling, strengthen data security and support DevOps processes. MLOps technologies assist businesses accelerate time-to-market for ML models, increase collaboration between data science and operations teams and scale AI initiatives across the organization.
MLOps can also assist organizations maintain data compliance and governance standards by ensuring that ML models are deployed and managed according to industry best practices. MLOps has a range of uses cases across industries, including finance, where it can facilitate fraud detection and risk assessment; healthcare, where it helps create diagnostic models and improve patient monitoring; and retail and e-commerce, which utilize MLOps services to create recommendation systems (“You may also like…” prompts in online shopping platforms, for instance) and streamline inventory management.
