SOURCE 6: https://www.techtarget.com/searchEnterpriseAI/tip/How-and-why-to-run-machine-learning-workloads-on-Kubernetes
Getty Images/iStockphoto By Michael Levan Published: 12 Aug 2024 Machine learning and AI have moved into the mainstream.
Regardless of their job role, most business and IT professionals are now familiar with leading AI tools like ChatGPT. As the buzz around AI grows, so do the engineering needs in ML and AI. In particular, managing machine learning workloads is top of mind for many organizations due to rising costs and complexity. Key considerations are related to how models are trained and deployed, including the scalability , efficiency and cost-effectiveness of those processes.
As ML utilize cases have become increasingly complex, training ML models has become more resource-intensive and less cost-effective. In fact, it's quite expensive -- and a key reason that GPUs have become so pricey and sought-after. Containerizing ML workloads can assist solve these challenges. Containerization can alleviate many of the challenges associated with ML model development and deployment, including scaling, automation and infrastructure sharing.
Kubernetes , a popular tool for containerizing workloads, represents viable option for organizations looking to streamline their ML processes. Kubernetes basics Over the years, engineering priorities have shifted, but one consistent trend is the require to minimize applications' operational footprints. From the mainframes of the late 1980s to modern servers and later virtualization, the trend was toward minimalism. After virtualization, containers emerged as a method for decoupling application stacks into the smallest possible entities while maintaining performance.
Containers started with cgroups and namespaces in Linux, but gained more widespread popularity with Docker. The problem was that containers alone didn't scale well; if a container went down, it didn't automatically begin back up. Kubernetes, an open source platform for managing containerized workloads, came onto the scene to fix this issue.
As an orchestration tool, Kubernetes not only helps developers build containerized applications, but also facilitates workload scaling, ensuring that containers are always active and properly managed. In Kubernetes, containers run inside resources called pods, which house all the information needed to run the application. In addition to containers, Kubernetes has also become valuable for orchestrating other types of resources, such as virtual machines.
Machine learning on Kubernetes AI and ML systems' demands represent major driver of the recent surge in GPU costs, which has posed challenges for consumers and tech pros alike. ML systems require vast amounts of system power, including CPU, memory and GPU resources. Without ample compute, the training process may be highly time-consuming, especially for larger models. Traditionally, this forced users to buy multiple servers to train models, as there was no way to efficiently share those resources.
That's where Kubernetes comes into play with its ability to orchestrate containers and decouple workloads. Within a Kubernetes cluster, multiple pods can run models simultaneously, using the same CPU, memory and GPU power for training. This can assist with many ML practices, including automated deployment and scaling. Although there still needs to be a powerful Kubernetes cluster with a GPU attached to the worker nodes , the ability to share resources increases production velocity and reduces costs.
Examples of ML workloads that may be run on Kubernetes include the following: Distributing model training tasks across multiple pods at the same time. Automatically deploying models to production, with the ability to create updates and rollbacks as needed. Optimizing model performance by concurrently running multiple hyperparameter tuning experiments. Scaling workloads dynamically based on demand at inference time.
ML on Kubernetes pitfalls Running ML workloads on Kubernetes represents stable and popular option. Even OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, runs its experiments on Kubernetes. However, organizations should be aware of two notable disadvantages: Tool maturity.
Software designed for running ML on Kubernetes, such as Kubeflow, is still relatively young. Because these tools are evolving, they might undergo changes over time, leading to instability and increased time spent keeping up with the latest developments. Finding experts with the knowledge and experience to effectively run ML on Kubernetes may be expensive and time-consuming. The specialized combination of IT operations and AI skills is in demand and relatively rare, making hiring costly and challenging.
Tools for machine learning on Kubernetes Kubernetes by itself isn't equipped to manage ML workloads; instead, it needs specific tools or software designed to run ML workloads on top of Kubernetes. These tools integrate with Kubernetes, using its orchestration capabilities to handle the specialized requirements of ML tasks. Just as Kubernetes uses a container runtime interface to interact with the software running containers, it uses a flexible plugin model to ensure that it can manage different types of resources.
There are three primary ML tools in the Kubernetes ecosystem: Kubeflow , an open source platform for running and experimenting with ML models on Kubernetes.
MLflow , a tool for running ML model training via a Flask interface as the inference endpoint. KubeRay , a tool built by the creators of Ray, an open source framework for scaling AI and Python-based applications. KubeRay adapts Ray's capabilities for Kubernetes environments. Another option is to utilize TensorFlow on Kubernetes. However, TensorFlow isn't built specifically for Kubernetes, so it lacks the dedicated integration and optimization of Kubernetes-focused tools like Kubeflow.
For those looking to run ML workloads on Kubernetes, exploring Kubeflow first is often the best option. At the time of writing, Kubeflow is the most advanced and mature tool in terms of capabilities, ease of utilize, community support and overall functionality.

Running large-scale AI/ML workloads on Kubernetes can feel like navigating a labyrinth of resource allocations, security hurdles, and monitoring demands-especially if you don’t have a solid plan in place.
Sure, it’s exciting to observe neural network tasks like image recognition or churn prediction, but there’s always the concern about pushing your cluster to its limits. MLOps represents friendly anchor here, bridging the gap between data scientists, DevOps folks, and security teams as a set of ideas and tools that assist you keep track of model creation, testing, and release. It encourages tight collaboration, so a data scientist on one team and a Kubernetes guru on another can confidently update a model without stepping on each other's toes.
When MLOps meets container orchestration, you obtain a more predictable way of controlling AI pipelines. Our goal with this article is to share the best practices for running complex AI tasks on Kubernetes. We'll talk about scaling, scheduling, security, resource management, and other elements that matter to seasoned platform engineers and folks just stepping into machine learning in Kubernetes. By walking through each section, you'll pick up practical tips to shield your cluster from AI security risks , keep your costs in check, and give your models the computing power they crave.
Kubernetes Secure Coding Practices [Cheat Sheet] This 10 page cheat sheet provides advanced, actionable guidance for infrastructure and platform developers to safeguard containerized applications. Download PDF Resource management Before you spin up containers for training or inference, it’s crucial to be sure that cluster resources match the intensity of your workloads. After all, ignoring GPU demands or skipping proper CPU sizing leads to slow performance, random out-of-memory kills, and disappointed teams.
GPU and specialized hardware allocation GPUs, TPUs, and other accelerators are like the sports cars in a cluster's garage. They let you train massive models or handle huge throughput during inference. Making these hardware resources available inside pods relies on device plugins provided by Kubernetes. For instance, by adding the official NVIDIA device plugin , you can request GPU slices per pod. One crucial tip? Setting proper resource requests ensures the scheduler spots the right node with the correct GPU.
If you skip those resource definitions, your workload might land on a node without the accelerator, causing job failures. It’s also helpful to label GPU nodes with something like nvidia. com/gpu=true to target them via nodeSelector or nodeAffinity easily. The code snippet below shows a basic pod specification that asks for one GPU from NVIDIA: apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: gpu-training-pod spec: containers: - name: gpu-training-container image: nvcr.
io/nvidia/tensorflow:22. 01-tf2-py3 resources: limits: nvidia. com/gpu: 1 nodeSelector: nvidia. com/gpu: "true" CPU and memory sizing Not every data pipeline or model training job needs a GPU. Many tasks run perfectly fine on CPUs if you size them correctly. By setting requests and limits, the Kubernetes scheduler knows how many pods fit on a node. Without these parameters, you risk poor scheduling or pods competing for the same CPU cores. To take scheduling to the next level, add cluster autoscaling to absorb sudden spikes in traffic or training jobs.
Remember to watch actual usage metrics carefully, using a monitoring system like Prometheus. If pods consistently hit 90% CPU, adjust the requests slightly. On the flip side, if pods stay around 20% CPU usage, you can reduce their requests. Below is an example deployment that defines CPU and memory requests and limits: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: ml-inference-deployment spec: replicas: 2 template: spec: containers: - name: ml-inference-container image: your-registry/ml-inference:latest resources: requests: cpu: "500m" memory: "512Mi" limits: cpu: "1000m" memory: "1024Mi" Scaling your AI/ML workloads Once you've pinned down how to request and allocate resources, it’s time to scale.
In some scenarios, you’ll be scaling inference pods horizontally to handle spiky incoming requests. In others, you’ll be scheduling large training jobs that might require specialized node types. Horizontal and vertical scaling Horizontal scaling is what you require to deal with unpredictable user loads, especially for inference endpoints. It’s best practice to set up HPAs to watch CPU or GPU usage, then spin up new pods when things heat up. Still, vertical scaling may be a better answer if your container needs more memory or CPU cores on a single node.
The Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) can assist you tweak requests for stable workloads over time. Here's a snippet of an HPA referencing a deployment by CPU usage: apiVersion: autoscaling/v2 kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler metadata: name: inference-hpa spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: inference-deployment minReplicas: 2 maxReplicas: 15 metrics: - type: Resource resource: name: cpu target: type: Utilization averageUtilization: 75 Batch jobs and scheduling Large-scale training is often better as a batch process.
To simplify your pipeline, utilize Kubernetes Jobs for one-off experiments and CronJobs for scheduled tasks like nightly retraining. By taking this approach, each successful job run means the model or artifact may be automatically stored somewhere for further utilize. A well-structured batch job ensures long-running training tasks do not overload your cluster nodes. To achieve this, you can request GPU or CPU resources in the same manner as any other pod, making sure you manage them effectively.
Below represents CronJob that launches a nightly training run: apiVersion: batch/v1 kind: CronJob metadata: name: nightly-model-training spec: schedule: "0 2 * * *" jobTemplate: spec: template: spec: containers: - name: training-container image: your-registry/training-image:latest resources: limits: nvidia. com/gpu: 1 command: [ "python" , "train. py" ] restartPolicy: Never Multi-cluster and hybrid strategies Sometimes it’s necessary to spread workloads across multiple Kubernetes clusters , especially if you desire redundancy or to run some jobs on-prem and others in the cloud.
This can save money and reduce risk. Tools like Anthos offer a management console that shows how jobs are distributed. If there's a problem in one environment, you can fail over to another, giving you peace of mind when you're juggling critical user-facing inference tasks. Figure 1: Anthos multi-cluster overview (Source: Google Cloud) Storage and data management Once your jobs can scale efficiently, data takes center stage. Where is it stored? How quickly can you read it?
How do you back it up? These questions pop up a lot when dealing with large training datasets, and they’re crucial to preventing data retrieval from becoming a bottleneck.
High-performance storage classes StorageClasses backed by SSDs are ideal for training workloads with big read/write demands. To create the most of them, define a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) that references the right StorageClass and the cluster provisions suitable for backing storage. Also, be sure to monitor read/write IOPS (input/output operations per second) to confirm that your storage volumes can handle the required throughput. Below represents PVC that asks for a high-performance storage class: piVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: fast-pvc spec: accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce storageClassName: high-perf-ssd resources: requests: storage: 100 Gi Data locality and caching In distributed training, data locality matters.
When workers grab data from remote volumes, network latency can cause slowdowns. Place caching layers in front of remote storage or pick node-local SSD volumes. Another strategy is to run a caching sidecar container in the same pod, which handles data reads and writes, improving performance in specific workflows. The snippet below shows a sidecar container that provides caching for training data: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: training-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: training-app template: metadata: labels: app: training-app spec: containers: - name: caching-sidecar image: your-registry/caching-sidecar:latest volumeMounts: - name: cache-volume mountPath: /cache - name: training-container image: your-registry/training-image:latest volumeMounts: - name: cache-volume mountPath: /dataset volumes: - name: cache-volume emptyDir: {} Backup and versioning Tracking model versions is standard for good reason: If new models fail in production (hey, it happens!), you’ll require frequent rollbacks.
Along with storing model artifacts in object storage, it’s also crucial to run scheduled backups. Even if you're using a cloud service that provides auto-backups, extra backups are the way to go to prevent problems down the line.
Below is an Argo Workflow that uploads model artifacts to a remote bucket in S3: apiVersion: argoproj. io/v1alpha1 kind: Workflow metadata: generateName: model-backup- spec: entrypoint: backup-model templates: - name: backup-model container: image: your-registry/backup-tool:latest command: [ "backup-model" ] args: [ "--model-path=/models" , "--destination=s3://ml-backups" ] Security considerations We've all seen the headlines about clusters being hijacked or data being exfiltrated-like the May 2024 unauthorized access incident at Hugging Face where attackers targeted their AI model hosting platform.
These breaches highlight why Kubernetes security and AI security have become a huge priority. When you combine containerized workloads with advanced ML pipelines, threat vectors multiply fast. Let's walk through a few ways to keep these risks in check. Fundamentals of Kubernetes security To strengthen security, follow these best practices: Scan container images to detect vulnerabilities before deployment. Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict who can deploy, modify, or delete workloads.
Apply Pod Security Standards (PSS) to prevent misconfigurations that could expose clusters to threats. Limit access to container registries and monitor for unauthorized changes. Tag images with stable references to ensure only verified versions are used in production. Here's an RBAC snippet that grants minimal privileges to a namespace: kind: Role apiVersion: rbac. io/v1 metadata: namespace : ml - project name : ml - project - role rules : - apiGroups : ["", " apps "] resources : [" pods ", " deployments "] verbs : [" obtain ", " list ", " create ", " update ", " delete "] --- kind : RoleBinding apiVersion : rbac.
io / v1 metadata : name : ml - project - rolebinding namespace : ml - project subjects : - kind : User name : ml - user apiGroup : rbac. io roleRef : kind : Role name : ml - project - role apiGroup : rbac. io Model integrity protection As AI models become more powerful and widely deployed, they also become targets for adversarial attacks, data poisoning, and distribution drift. Attackers may manipulate training data to undermine model performance or exploit weaknesses in the model’s logic.
To mitigate these threats, monitor incoming data for anomalies, utilize drift detection tools to spot when your model’s real-world performance starts slipping, and train (or retrain) only on vetted datasets. Maintaining this vigilance helps ensure your model stays accurate and resilient in the face of evolving threats. Below represents sample Python snippet showing how you can utilize the Alibi Detect library to detect data drift: from alibi_detect.
cd import KSDrift import numpy as np # Reference data (e. baseline training data) X_ref = np. rand( 1000 , 10 ) # New incoming data (e. live traffic samples) X = np. rand( 1000 , 10 ) # Replace with actual production data # Initialize the drift detector cd = KSDrift(X_ref, p_val= 0. 05 ) # Run drift check preds = cd. predict(X) if preds[ 'data_drift' ]: print ( "Data drift detected! P-value:" , preds[ 'p_val' ]) # Optionally, trigger a retraining pipeline or alert else : print ( "No data drift detected.
P-value:" , preds[ 'p_val' ]) Image signing Once you’ve taken steps to preserve model integrity, the next layer of defense is confirming a model’s authenticity by signing container images that hold your model artifacts. Tools like Cosign create it straightforward to add digital signatures, while encryption at rest and a chain of custody for training data assist further safeguard your ecosystem-especially in regulated industries. You can sign your container image with a simple Cosign command: $ cosign sign -- key cosign.
key your-registry/your- image :tag On top of that, add automated code scanning steps in CI pipelines. This helps catch potential vulnerabilities in dependencies before they reach production. Below represents code snippet that integrates Trivy, an open-source security scanner, into a GitHub Actions pipeline: name: code-scanning-workflow on: [ push , pull_request ] jobs: scan: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v2 - name: Scan with Trivy uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master with: image-ref: "your-registry/your-image:latest" format: "table" Network isolation and zero trust Securing AI workloads starts with strong network isolation.
One effective approach is to define NetworkPolicies that restrict which pods and namespaces can communicate with each other. Beyond that, it's best practice to avoid running AI/ML workloads alongside other applications in the same cluster. By segmenting workloads based on purpose-such as separating inference services from general web applications-you minimize the risk of lateral movement in case of a breach.
This approach aligns with zero-trust principles, where every piece of network traffic is treated cautiously, even if it's internal to the cluster. Combined with strong identity access management, these guardrails assist prevent accidental data leaks and infiltration attempts. Here's a NetworkPolicy that limits traffic to only the inference namespace: apiVersion: networking. io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: allow-namespace-traffic namespace: inference spec: podSelector: {} ingress: - from: - namespaceSelector: matchLabels: purpose: inference End-to-end visibility: From code to runtime AI/ML workloads introduce complex security and compliance challenges that span the entire lifecycle-from code development to runtime execution.
Without full visibility, misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and drift can creep into your Kubernetes clusters, increasing the risk of breaches. To tackle this, teams require a security strategy that covers every stage of the AI pipeline: scanning infrastructure-as-code (IaC) configurations, securing container images, enforcing runtime protections , and continuously monitoring for anomalies. By integrating security controls across the pipeline, you ensure that AI workloads remain resilient and compliant.
Wiz offers a platform that allows you to track vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and security posture across your cluster in real time. Take advantage of the Wiz dashboard to spot container image problems, misconfigurations, and even secrets lurking in code: Figure 2: Wiz compliance dashboard overview Observability: Monitoring, logging and tracing When tuning your cluster for machine learning workloads, you’re aiming for a crystal-clear view of what's happening.
That means collecting metrics from pods, storing logs in a centralized location, and tracking requests across microservices. Thorough observability makes troubleshooting a no-brainer when something misfires. Metrics and alerting Prometheus usually sits at the heart of your monitoring stack, helping you track key performance metrics. To ensure smooth AI/ML operations, utilize a combination of tools: Prometheus collects CPU, memory, and GPU usage metrics from model inference services.
Grafana provides real-time dashboards to visualize cluster performance and detect anomalies. Alerting rules automatically trigger notifications (e. , Slack alerts) when resource usage exceeds defined thresholds. By combining these tools, you maintain full visibility into AI workloads and can quickly respond to performance issues before they impact production. Below represents PrometheusRule that alerts on high GPU usage: apiVersion: monitoring. com/v1 kind: PrometheusRule metadata: name: gpu-usage-rules namespace : monitoring spec : groups : - name : gpu - alerts rules : - alert : HighGPUUsage expr : nvidia_gpu_utilization > 90 for : 5m labels : severity : warning annotations : summary : " High GPU usage detected " Distributed tracing and performance insights OpenTelemetry represents great choice for distributed tracing, especially if your AI pipeline includes multiple microservices.
Each service emits trace spans, helping you pinpoint where a bottleneck might exist. This approach is priceless when
## Debugging
: Figure 3: OpenTelemetry and Jaeger (Source: Red Hat) Correlating security and performance with Wiz Sometimes, a performance drop is tied to a security-related event. Wiz helps you observe that correlation by blending security findings with performance data. Maybe a suspicious process is hogging GPU resources or a known vulnerability is leading to cluster instability.
When you observe these patterns, Wiz prompts an immediate fix. Figure 4: Wiz Security Graph for root cause analysis 🚨Kubernetes Security Research Report 2025 New insights from 200,000+ cloud accounts uncovers the latest risks, attack trends, and security gaps in Kubernetes environments. Download PDF CI/CD for AI/ML workflows We all understand shipping a trained model involves more than just copying a file. You desire to fully automate building, testing, and deploying ML artifacts.
This is where CI/CD pipelines come in handy. You can chain tasks that run tests, scan images, push them to a registry, and then roll out new versions to production. Automating model lifecycle management Tools like Tekton or Argo Workflows let you define pipelines for the entire model lifecycle, from data prep to training to deployment. Each stage is triggered automatically whenever you commit a change, which keeps the process consistent. You can also add validation checks to ensure a model meets predefined accuracy thresholds before tagging it for production.
This helps prevent underperforming models from being deployed and impacting user experience. Below represents Tekton PipelineRun that kicks off model building and deployment: apiVersion: tekton. dev/v1beta1 kind: PipelineRun metadata: name: ml-pipeline-run spec: pipelineRef: name: ml-build-deploy-pipeline workspaces: - name: shared-data volumeClaimTemplate: spec: accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ] resources: requests: storage: 5 Gi params: - name: model-name value: "my-ml-model" Immutable artifacts and GitOps It’s handy to tag images with commit hashes so you understand exactly which version of the code or model you're running.
GitOps extends that practice by letting you store Kubernetes manifests in a Git repo. Any changes to those manifests are automatically applied to the cluster in a controlled manner. This method helps you track precisely when and why changes happen. Here's an Argo CD Application referencing Git repository for managing deployment configurations: apiVersion: argoproj. io/v1alpha1 kind: Application metadata: name: ml-inference-app spec: destination: namespace : ml - inference server : https :// kubernetes.
svc source : repoURL : ' https :// github. com / your - org / ml - deploy - configs. git ' targetRevision : main path : manifests / inference project : default syncPolicy : automated : prune : true selfHeal : true Performance optimization Models have to respond quickly and not waste expensive GPU or CPU hours. Luckily, minor tweaks in HPA parameters or load balancing rules can shave off precious milliseconds and reduce costs by a solid margin. Load balancing Load balancing with Ingress resources helps route traffic to the right inference service.
To separate different versions of a model, you have the option to utilize path-based routing. Below is an Ingress with path-based routing to multiple inference services: apiVersion: networking. io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: inference-ingress spec: rules: - host: ml. com http: paths: - path: /v1/ pathType: Prefix backend: service: name: inference-model-v1 port: number: 8081 - path: /v2/ pathType: Prefix backend: service: name: inference-model-v2 port: number: 8081 Cost profiling and optimization Everyone likes to watch how their GPU nodes, CPU nodes, and memory usage line up with spending.
But manually adjusting resources may be time-consuming and inefficient. That’s where tools like Karpenter and Autopilot can automatically scale cluster nodes to match resource demands, saving you from manual node provisioning. For training workloads that don’t require persistent compute, leveraging Spot Instances can dramatically reduce costs-just create sure your pipeline can handle potential interruptions. Below is an example of Karpenter configuration for matching instance types to workloads: apiVersion: karpenter.
sh/v1alpha5 kind: Provisioner metadata: name : default spec: requi rements: - key : "node. io/instance-type" operator: In values: [ "m5. xlarge" ] provider: subnetSelector: karpenter. sh/discovery: "my-cluster" securityGroupSelector: karpenter. sh/discovery: "my-cluster" Another way to save big? utilize a tool like Wiz to observe if there are cost drivers related to misconfigured resources or unusual usage patterns.
Wiz also helps you harden the nodes during creation to create sure that they are not only automatically scaled but also secure. Figure 5: Wiz cloud cost rules Conclusion We've talked through various strategies for machine learning workflows on Kubernetes. From resource management to AI security best practices to hooking up Tekton pipelines, we've seen how each piece can contribute to a stable platform.
