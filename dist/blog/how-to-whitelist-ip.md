Home Guide What is IP Whitelisting? Related Product Live Cross-browser testing On This Page What is IP Whitelisting? What is IP address? What are IP Packets? How does IP Whitelisting Work? Benefits of IP Whitelisting Difference between IP Whitelist and Blocklist (Blacklisting) How to Whitelist an IP Address? What is IP Whitelisting? IP whitelisting represents crucial security measure that restricts access to specific IP addresses, ensuring that only authorized users can connect to your systems. By creating a list of trusted IP addresses—essentially a “whitelist”—only devices with those addresses can access certain resources, enhancing security and minimizing the risk of unauthorized access. This guide explores the fundamentals of IP whitelisting, its importance in enhancing security protocols, and practical steps to implement it effectively in your organization. What is IP Whitelisting? IP whitelisting represents security measure that restricts unauthorized access to a system or network by whitelisting IP addresses. IP Whitelisting helps businesses give access of the tools and software to specific IP addresses they consider trustworthy and blocks unauthorized users. IP Whitelisting enhances security and positively affects your automated security and ensures that each IP address accessing your tools is trustworthy and without any threats. What is IP address? An IP address, on the other hand, represents unique numerical identifier assigned to a device or network. It helps in identifying the device or network. It consists of alpha numeric characters separated by periods. Examples of IP Addresses: 192. 1 2001:db8::1 IP address helps devices communicate and send data to each other over the internet or a local network. IP addresses play a fundamental role in routing data packets, allowing them to be correctly delivered to their intended destinations. Types of IP addresses: IPv4 IPv6 IP addresses can either be dynamic or static. Dynamic IP address change over time as devices connect and disconnect from a network, whereas static IP addresses remain fixed. What are IP Packets? When a device wants to send data across an IP network, it divides the data into smaller packets. Each of these packets contain a small portion of the original data along with the necessary IP header information. These packets are then transmitted individually across the network and can take different paths to reach the destination. Upon reaching the destination device, the IP packets are reassembled based on the information in their headers and delivered to the appropriate higher-level protocol or application for further processing. IP packets are designed to be independent and self-contained, allowing for efficient routing, handling of network congestion, and reliable data delivery. They provide the foundation for reliable and scalable communication over IP networks, enabling the exchange of data between devices across different networks and locations. How does IP Whitelisting Work? When only specific IP addresses obtain access by a network administrator to access a network, may be termed as the Whitelist IP meaning. It is based on the strict policy that is shared by the network administrator, who allows only certain IP addresses. The network appliance or software server gets a list of applications and destinations that a user requires to access. The network administrators also compile this list. After applying the list to the server, when the device or application requests access, it is allowed if it is whitelisted. Moreover, any services or application that is not whitelisted cannot be used by the user. Whitelist permits communication to specific applications or services, while others are denied as: They either be a malicious code or ransomware Contains a material that does not comply with the company’s internet guidelines Is facilitating the utilize of ShadowIT Has a potential risk of leaking sensitive data. Must Read: How to Test and Debug Local Sites on Mobile Devices Connected to a Network? Benefits of IP Whitelisting IP whitelisting provides an easy and secure way to access private network resources. Below are the benefits of using a whitelist IP address: Improved Cloud Security: By improving system security, you can prevent unauthorized access to your network against an IP address not under your whitelist. Elevated Productivity: Unsecured sites can reduce productivity and reduce the profits of your company. Therefore, businesses take whitelisting of IP seriously to increase their team and business productivity. Secured Remote Access: Organizations can allow employees to utilize their own devices while mitigating the cloud and on-site risks that might impact your company’s profit and projects. Difference between IP Whitelist and Blocklist (Blacklisting) When your server or system denies access to a specific list of applications, IP addresses, and websites, it is known as blacklisting. Many antiviruses blacklist IP addresses to block potential threats. At the same time, whitelisting denies access to any IP address, application, or website that is not mentioned on the list, only allowing access to those on the list. While whitelisting represents default-deny approach, blacklisting represents default-allow approach. How to Whitelist an IP Address? IP whitelisting involves configuring the network/system settings. The steps vary depending on the network infrastructure, operating system, or the application you are working with. Process of Whitelisting an IP Address Identify the IP addresses or IP range that you desire to whitelist Access the network or system settings Configure the whitelist Add the whitelisted IP addresses Save and apply the changes Talk to an Expert Conclusion IP whitelisting represents valuable security practice for organizations to control and restrict access to their networks, systems, and services. It helps protect against unauthorized access attempts and ensures that only approved IP addresses can communicate with the protected resources.

Solution Go to Policy & Object -> Addresses : Choose the tab 'Address Group': Create new objects: one for IP addresses and one for URLs: Go to Policy & Object -> Firewall Policy : Create a new policy, and choose the LAN interface as a source, and set the destination to the WAN or SD-WAN interface: Choose the newly added object groups as the Source: Since the traffic shall be forwarded to the Internet, enable Network Address Translation (NAT). To 'whitelist' or bypass the traffic the Security Profiles must be deactivated, and 'no-inspection' for 'SSL Inspection: In the logging section, for monitoring purposes, the option to be chosen is "All sessions", since 'Security Events' will only log Security (UTM) events (e. AV, IPS, firewall web filter) that are currently disabled. Once the traffic is confirmed to be matching the policy, the logging may be disabled. It is necessary to move the firewall policy to the top to avoid matching all the other firewall policies: Now that the firewall policy is in place, edit the object group to add the IP addresses or URLs: In the section 'Select Entries', choose the option to add a new object, then choose address: For URLs, change the type to 'FQDN' and input the URL desired. Adding a wildcard is supported, but it is recommended to create sure that the DNS settings are properly set in order to populate the DNS resolutions to the FQDN objects properly. For IP addresses, choose the type 'Subnet'. This type supports subnets and specific IP addresses. To add a specific range of IP addresses, utilize the type 'IP Range'. Observe the new address object, added to the whitelist object group: Save the configuration once all of the object addresses are added, and confirm the configuration by hovering the mouse over the whitelist objects: To confirm that the whitelist policy is matched, may utilize the 'Policy Lookup' feature: Technical Tip: Firewall policy lookups 28286 9 Kudos Suggest New Article Article Feedback Comments lpedraza Staff ‎08-22-2024 10:43 AM Mark as Read Mark as New Bookmark Permalink Print Report Inappropriate Content Geat article @Carlos !!!

Let's break this topic down and describe how it can assist your business. Table of Contents What is an IP address? What represents whitelist? What is IP whitelisting? IP packets explained Why IP whitelisting represents good choice for your business The benefits of IP whitelisting The cons of IP whitelisting How to begin with IP whitelisting via a VPN IP whitelisting in 2023: A fresh perspective Key Terms: An internet protocol (IP) address represents unique number that is assigned to a device when it connects to the internet. It becomes your address as you browse the web. IP whitelisting is when you only allow a certain IP address to access wherever you store your business information, such as on a server. A static IP address is one that never changes. You would require your employees to have static IP addresses so that you can whitelist them. The opposite of a static IP address represents dynamic IP address, which constantly changes. A local area network (LAN) represents computer network that connects devices that are in a limited area, like in an office building. What Is an IP address? An IP address represents unique number that gets assigned to your device when you connect to the internet. This unique code helps devices talk to one another and exchange data on the internet. There are two main types of IP addresses: Static IP addresses. You can learn more about static and dynamic IP addresses in this blog post. What represents Whitelist? A whitelist (allowlist) is an administrator-defined register of entities approved for authorized access to digital resources such as networks, apps, or to perform specific actions. Whitelisting may be used to improve security by ensuring that only approved users or devices have access to sensitive data or systems. It can also be used to ensure that only authorized actions may be performed on critical resources. Whitelisting represents stringent cybersecurity technique that, if done correctly, can prevent many cybersecurity issues by default. However, it may be time-consuming and inconvenient for administrators and must be implemented and maintained precisely. It isn't, however, an impenetrable barrier to assaults. How does a whitelist work? Think about it like a guest list for an exclusive event. If your name is on the list, you obtain access to the event without any hassle. If your name is not on the list, you shall be sent away. A whitelist will restrict network access to anyone whose IP address does not match one on the list. This improves your security. Only users with approved devices have access to your data or systems. Typically, a whitelist would be created to allow an authorized user to do things like access a network. With a whitelist in place, no one can access your exclusive online event unless they are invited, either. What Is IP Whitelisting? The whitelisting of an IP address represents cybersecurity technique that gives IT administrators control over who can access business systems and resources. IP whitelisting (allowlisting) involves creating a list of trusted IP addresses (dedicated static IP addresses are necessary), assigning them to a user or group of users as a unique identifier, and permitting the IP address on the target server only. As a result, any system inside the LAN, datacenter or third-party SaaS application may be set up to be accessed only by users with the organization’s IP address, whether they connect from a private corporate network or through a VPN gateway. Unknown entities trying to access the system from an unlisted IP address shall be restricted. A cloud VPN service like GoodAccess can assist you set up a whitelist with static IP addresses. IP whitelisting is typically handled on Firewall - configured to grant access to the network only to specific users/devices/LANs Edge routers - typically set up to block undesired traffic on router's TCP and UDP port in order to protect internal LAN from the public internet threats Business VPN gateway - observe types of VPN to learn more Web server - typically to manage incoming requests and prevent extensive malicious requests (brute force attacks) Application layer - incoming queries may be evaluated and blocked/allowed by design in the code of the application SaaS application - SaaS apps usually allow setting up IP whitelists to harden security measures. Fig 1: IP whitelisting settings in Amazon AWS (so called security groups). This example shows allowing TCP/UDP traffic only from GoodAccess VPN gateway. Fig 2: Whitelisted IP address of the GoodAccess VPN gateway in Amazon AWS settings. How can I whitelist an IP address? If you desire to create an IP whitelist, you would require to decide which devices and users are allowed to access your business systems. ‍ Once you have a list of approved IP addresses, web applications, or users, you can add them to your whitelist using the network settings on your computer, router or firewall. You may require to configure a router to create the whitelist or edit firewall rules on your device. This will depend on your setup and security requirements. This would be similar to compiling a list of attendees for your exclusive event in real life and then passing the list on to the doorman at your venue to manage entry. The process of IP whitelisting is not straightforward, though, and you can easily create mistakes. GoodAccess acts as the perfect doorman and makes IP whitelisting and managing access simple. How can IP whitelisting IP addresses assist my business? IP whitelisting puts you in the driver’s seat. Other than advanced security, an IP whitelist also allows you to manage your remote team effectively. It puts you in control when it comes to which employees can access different levels of your company’s information and who can perform specific tasks. For example, you can give your senior management team permission to change documents stored on your server. Junior staff, however, would not receive the same permissions. IP Packets Explained Now—for the nitty gritty—let’s elaborate on how IP whitelisting works. Every communication between servers or clients, over the Internet, LAN, or a private virtual network, always sends data in packets. Each packet contains the source and target IP address. These addresses are always public because they tell Internet routers where to direct the data. Once a packet reaches its destination, the target device/server/service reads the source address and if it is whitelisted, the packet is accepted. If not, it rejects the data, i. informs the sender of rejecting it, or discards the packet altogether. This means the following: Only users with a whitelisted IP can access your business remotely. Anyone else who tries to access your systems from any location shall be blocked immediately. Your remote business is protected from any security issues. Your private business information is secure. Why IP Whitelisting represents Good Choice for Your Business If your business has software, systems, and stored data, you require to protect them. You must ensure nobody can access this information unless they are an employee. You also require a way to ensure that your remote employees can access your systems safely and securely. IP whitelisting helps you achieve both of these things. Let’s unpack some of the circumstances where IP whitelists would be useful for your organization. Network Access Control One of the most common utilize cases is restricting network access to your internet-facing services by using a firewall, where only whitelisted IP addresses are allowed to connect to the service. Only with a static IP can you define a firewall rule that remains valid indefinitely. SaaS Access Control Blind trust in SaaS provider security measures might be tricky. To further harden cloud resource security, SaaS applications such as Salesforce, Amazon AWS, Office365, etc. , usually allow the whitelisting of an IP address within provider security settings. Remote Access Enablement Remote users connect via networks where company policies cannot be enforced, such as a home office or public wi-fi at airports, hotels, and cafés. So it makes sense to protect the connection to target systems via, e. , a VPN gateway with whitelisted static IP. First, the user connects to the gateway via a client app installed on a particular device, and after authentication and verification, access is allowed to specific systems. In such a scenario, the user’s connection is protected from any device where they successfully log into the app. IoT Security You may desire to secure Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as cameras, sensors, or building controllers that utilize a public network to communicate with other devices. IP whitelisting represents simple way to ensure that only trusted users can access your IoT devices. Fig 3: When you combine IP whitelisting with system access control, you have a comprehensive way to ensure that only authorized users access your services. (source: GoodAccess feature named Access Cards) Unifying access control on the network layer Software and systems often require users to perform something called two-factor authentication. This is an additional security measure to ensure that users are permitted to access the software. It can, however, become problematic if you have many software applications requiring two-factor authentication. By having an IP whitelist and VPN gateway in place, you are already authenticating the user, so you will not require two-factor authentication, too. The Benefits of IP Whitelisting We have already mentioned why IP whitelisting represents good choice for your business if you are looking to boost your security measures. Here are some further benefits to consider: Simplicity: IP whitelisting enables any company to strengthen its network security, and it only takes a few simple steps. Improved security: IP whitelisting has a default deny approach. This means that network-based attacks are blocked. Better access control: Whitelisting specific IP addresses represents convenient technique for preventing unauthorized access to certain network resources. Additional visibility and control: IP whitelisting gives you more control over who accesses business resources. Cost reduction: You don't have to build your own infrastructure, and you can still utilize a public internet connection securely. The Cons of IP Whitelisting The downside to IP whitelisting is that it represents repetitive and time-consuming process, especially if you have network administrators who manage large networks with many users and devices. Especially those IT admins who manage large networks with tons of users and devices, may suffer from the following: Setting-up a whitelist is (may be) labor-intensive Every user and every IP address needs to have their access rights properly evaluated and manually implemented on the firewall, router etc. On one hand, overly restrictive whitelists may limit the smooth running of business operations. On the other, an overly permissive allowlist loses its purpose of hardening network security. Managing up-to-date whitelists requires additional resources When the user roles or access rights change frequently, it requires additional work to keep whitelists responsive. However, there are ways to create the whitelisting process smoother and more efficient. Instead of whitelisting the IP address of each device (which is virtually undoable due to the require for many static IPs), IT administrators can only whitelist the dedicated static IP address of the VPN gateway. With modern cloud VPNs , which also provide zero-trust access control , such as GoodAccess, this represents highly convenient approach to reduce the complexity of IP whitelisting and preserve a high-level of security: The IT admin whitelists the VPN's static IP address on the target system (LAN, app, cloud etc. ) so that only users connecting to the business resources via the VPN are allowed access. The VPN serves as an access control point. The IT admin can easily assign every user with the necessary access rights to the business resources. This is done via the VPN's web UI. To access the target system, users must first sign in to VPN and be authorized by 2FA, MFA, or SSO. Once this is done, the VPN “knows” what systems the authorized user is permitted to utilize and allows access. This approach minimizes manual configuration and centralizes whitelist management on the VPN level so that businesses can enjoy benefits of whitelisting IP without the sacrificing valuable time of its administrators. Fig 4: IP whitelisting combined with system access control on VPN level reduces complexity (source: GoodAccess feature named Access Cards) How to begin with IP Whitelisting via VPN Ensure you have a VPN gateway in place. Ensure you have a dedicated static IP address for your team. Navigate to the settings of the target device, service, or firewall and add a rule that allows incoming traffic to the protected service or network only from the static IP which is assigned to the VPN gateway. Deny all other incoming traffic. Before confirming these settings, be sure you are connected to the gateway in order not to lose network access. Test the connection from a public network (via a smartphone, for example) to prove that nonwhitelisted IPs cannot access the service. IP Whitelisting in 2023: A Fresh Perspective IP whitelisting represents powerful security technique for businesses to utilize, but it is not the ultimate answer to all your remote working security concerns. However, when IP whitelisting is done correctly, it can significantly enhance the protection of business resources and also assist your business to comply with regulations that require data protection and strict access control (such as NIS2 ). As it follows the principle “deny all, permit some,” it restricts external traffic to a preselected number of IP addresses and, by design, reduces the attack surface and risks associated with unauthorized access. There are also drawbacks which create working with whitelists a tough job. Especially the labor/time-intensity of setting up and maintaining IP whitelists as well as the additional complexity of managing whitelists in different places (firewall, VPN, SaaS app, etc. But there are ways to create whitelisting simpler , such as using a cloud VPN like GoodAccess which lets you: Manage IP whitelists from one web GUI, Extend whitelists to services and applications that do not natively support IP whitelisting, Apply the zero-trust network access principle by assigning every user a private account and network identity so they are allowed to access only the applications they require to do their job, Unify multifactor authentication security on the network level instead of laborious manual configuration for each application. This works even if your systems don't support 2FA/MFA on the application level.

How to Blacklist or Whitelist IP’s on Your Website In this how-to, we’ll cover how you can blacklist or whitelist an IP on your website with the assist of. htaccess or Cloudflare. We’ll also discuss why and when you should desire to do so. Table of contents What is IP blacklisting? What is IP whitelisting? When and why should I desire to blacklist or whitelist an IP? Blacklist/whitelist IP’s in. htaccess Blacklist/whitelist IP’s in Cloudflare What is IP blacklisting? IP blacklisting represents method to block all (malicious, illegitimate or not wanted) traffic to your website by blocking IP addresses. What is IP whitelisting? IP whitelisting is the opposite of IP blacklisting where you grant an IP access to your website instead of blocking it. When and why should I desire to blacklist or whitelist an IP? Blacklisting an IP (blocking) from accessing your website should be done if you experience malicious, illegitimate or not wanted traffic to your website from one or more IP addresses.

IP whitelisting represents way of giving access to your data to specific, trusted, and pre-approved IP addresses. This increases the security of your data and ensures safe remote access. Here's the list of SuperAnnotate IPs you may require to whitelist when using integrations (for AWS and Azure, you can read more about the process below): 54. 194 Here's the list of SuperAnnotate URLs you may require to whitelist in case of any access difficulties: app. com work-management-api. com AWS How can I restrict access to my S3 bucket by IP address? To give access to your S3 bucket to a specific IP address, you require to create a policy for your S3 bucket or edit it if you already have one. Policy example The following policy gives access to the following IP address 54. With this IP address, you can access the buckets stated in Resource. What you require to do is replace the values in Resource and IpAddress with your own values and create or edit the policy of your bucket. JSON { "Version": "2012-10-17", "Id": "S3Allowlisting", "Statement": [ { "Sid": "IPAllow", "Effect": "Allow", "Principal": "*", "Action": "s3:*", "Resource": [ "arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET", "arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/*" ], "Condition": { "IpAddress": { "aws:SourceIp": ["54. 0/87"] } } } ] } Statement key Since the statement key is an array, you can add multiple statements for different files and folders. Condition block The condition block consists of the IpAddress condition and the aws:SourceIp condition key. The aws:SourceIp condition key is an AWS-wide condition key. Learn more about condition keys. The values of aws:SourceIp IPv4 utilize the standard CIDR notation. For more information, check out the IAM JSON policy elements reference. How can I create or edit the policy of my S3 bucket? To create or edit as S3 bucket’s policy: Go to your Amazon S3 console. Go to the bucket where you desire to create a policy.

Azure Azure offers 2 options to restrict access to Azure resources from the given range of IP addresses: Put a firewall with the list of IP addresses on the Azure storage account. Generate an IP-restricted SAS token on an Azure account/container/blob. Method 1 This method allows you to create the container’s blobs accessible only from the given range of IP addresses. Go to your storage account. Under Data storage , select Containers. Click Change access level. Under Public access level , choose Blob (anonymous read access for blobs only). Under Security + Networking , select Networking. Under Firewall , add the IP address or the IP addresses and ranges that you desire to whitelist. Click here for more details. To add these Blob URLs to SuperAnnotate, utilize the attach_items function. Method 2 This method allows you to generate a shared access token with IP restrictions and utilize it in the signed URL of the given resource. You can utilize this method for storage accounts, containers, and blobs. The following steps describe the setup of the container’s SAS token. You can utilize this method to also generate a SAS token for storage accounts and blobs. Choose Shared access tokens under Settings. Under Allowed IP addresses , define the IP address or the IP range that are allowed to access the container. Click Generate SAS token and URL. Save the generated SAS token. Click here for more details. With this method, the container blobs shall be accessible from the given range of IP addresses via signed URLs. To attach these URLs to SuperAnnotate, create a CSV file that contains these URLs and utilize it in the attach_items SDK function.
