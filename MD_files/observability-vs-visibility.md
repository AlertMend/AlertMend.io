This is not possible without network observability. Organisations can now observe inside the whole network architecture to explore problems as they happen. Observability represents property of the network system and should not be confused with visibility which provides limited metrics for troubleshooting. With observability, organisations can create the whole state of the network observable and those limitations no longer exist. Observability provides the contextual data operators require to analyse and gain new and deeper insights into the network. This enables teams to proactively create more informed decisions to improve network performance and to strengthen their overall security posture because context is now available to troubleshoot incidents and create policy changes in real-time. Unfortunately, observability is often miscommunicated and misunderstood, as visibility is repackaged by some vendors and sold as observability, when the two are not the same. Visibility and monitoring have an crucial role to play but observability is different. Visibility and the metrics it provides limits troubleshooting, whereas observability provides rich contextual data to gain deeper insights and understanding based on the raw data collected from the network or system. With research showing that the average lifecycle of a data breach is 279 days, it is clear that organisations are slowly putting observability into practice and adopting ‘ observability as a culture’. In the case of some well-known breaches, however, the timescales were much longer than that. The Marriott International breach, which was discovered in November 2018, saw hackers freely access the network since 2014. During this time, no unusual activity was detected and no alerts of the hacker’s access were raised. Additionally, in the British Airways data breach in 2018, data was compromised over a two-week period, affecting 500,000 customers. This resulted in the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) announcing that it intended to fine British Airways £183. 39M for infringements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These two examples alone demonstrate how essential it is for organisations to begin to value the ability to comprehend their systems and behaviour by making their network observable. Understanding Observability Simply defined, observability represents measure of how well something is working internally, concluded from what occurs externally. Observability is creating applications with the idea that someone is going to observe them with the aim of strengthening and making system access decisions. The right combination of contextual data may be used to gain a deeper understanding of network policy deployment and every application that tries to communicate across the network. With an observability capability, attackers will therefore have a hard time attempting lateral ‘east-west’ movements or remaining hidden in the data centre or across the WAN. In turn, observability can provide a global view of the network environment and visual proof that the security strategy is effective and working. Unfortunately, it’s not uncommon for infiltrations to go undetected in networks for days, weeks or months. This means infiltrations are going undetected for longer and networks systems are more increasingly vulnerable. To effectively do this, all roles require to observe inside the entire architecture. And, when this capability is built in, it is observability that enables greater insight into the overall reliability, impact and success of systems, their workload and their behaviour. Conclusion Research shows that companies who are able to detect and contain a breach in less than 200 days spend $1. 2 million less on the total cost of a breach. That’s a figure no organisation can - or should - ignore. Organisations require a cyber security solution that may be measured and traced. Observability provides the contextual data so organisations can take measurable steps towards controlling system access of the network environment. With this type of observable analysis, organisations can gain deeper insights into how to enhance their security policy and detect unwanted access as it occurs.

Network Services 4-minute read 13 March 2023 Visibility and observability are mission-critical for your network To meet user demands, complex and distributed networks require immediate issue identification and resolution. Data-driven observability can obtain you there Matthew Allen Vice President, Service Offer Management – Networking at NTT DATA 13 March 2023 4-minute read Contents Visibility and observability are mission-critical for your network {{slide. title}} share Topics in this article Network as a Service Digital infrastructure Widely distributed enterprise networks, already intricate to manage, are facing a new reality: hybrid working is here to stay. Far fewer employees now choose the office as their primary workplace – and for this network-dependent workforce, outages are unacceptable. Detecting and resolving network and IT issues faster boosts productivity, guarantees a lighter workload for IT teams and creates a better user experience. But in complex IT environments, it remains a challenge to locate the source of a network problem and discover the time to fix it. And, unsurprisingly, 89% of IT executives have operational concerns about running complex, intelligent networks while complying with security requirements, according to NTT’s 2022–23 Global Network Report. Fortunately, innovative new platforms and technologies are advancing the possibilities of network visibility and observability with automated monitoring. Extending the scope of network visibility with data-driven observability promises to create it easier to keep your network running. Before you upgrade your network, obtain to understand the differences between visibility and observability. Then, discover the balance between them that will deliver results for your organization. Beyond the network observability buzz Increasing network visibility is linked to improved monitoring. It focuses on using your monitoring results to have a solid grasp of what's happening across your IT environment, including the impact of events on business processes and users. As network data volumes grow dramatically and more devices connect to networks than ever before, network monitoring can no longer rely on the labor-intensive and manual approaches of the past. There’s a compelling business case for shifting to automation instead. AI-enabled processes and platforms can lead to a massive reduction in the number of incidents requiring manual intervention, along with a noticeable improvement in both the time needed to identify issues and the time required to repair them. If visibility is about having a clear picture, then observability is about getting the big picture – and finding answers, fast. Network observability allows us to move beyond individual network infrastructure components to observe the bigger picture. Data and insights gathered through sophisticated monitoring, powered by AI, machine learning and IoT, gives teams deep and granular insights into trends and performance. They can collect a broad and complete set of data on the network's past, current and future states, leading to actionable insights. This allows your organization to identify and comprehend patterns of network issues and put preventive measures in place. Overcoming challenges to improve network visibility Modern organizations require modern networks, yet legacy infrastructure – including hardware and software in standalone, disparate systems – is holding many back. Older networks prevent complete monitoring and observability. It can take hours, even days, to identify the root causes of issues. When a single component goes down, this can have a domino effect on network access and users. To address this, you require to go beyond seeing just the various elements of your IT environment to reach complete network visibility, down to each network layer, while paying attention to the user experience. Digitalized network monitoring strategies allow you to measure normal conditions, understand when and why performance is lagging, and optimize network traffic more effectively, accurately and holistically. Introducing network observability into your core operations The more observable your network is, the better. You’ll be able to solve more performance issues, in real time, end to end – from device and user access to cloud applications. Observability relies on gathering network metrics, events, traces and logs. This requires digitalization across tools and practices, and for this, you require digitalized infrastructure. Gaining a single view and deeper understanding of your network means untangling any current complexities, upgrading your systems and platforms, and breaking down IT silos so you can observe your network as a single entity. Observing cloud applications and performance presents many challenges, especially as traffic can bypass corporate infrastructure and take on unidentified loads. To digitally aggregate what's happening across multicloud environments, the applications, infrastructure stacks and user experience require to be built into your core operations. Making users the key metric of your enterprise network Your corporate IT network is only as good as the user experience. Every investment, decision, question and effort needs to relate to how your IT assets function and how they improve the user experience. As the needs of users evolve, with remote workers expecting office-like performance and hybrid workers looking for a home-like experience, proactively managing your network performance has never been more crucial. The move to more digitalized networks for better observability, actionable insights and informed decisions will keep your organization moving forward.

By Andrew Froehlich, West Gate Networks Published: 03 Jun 2021 As IT infrastructures become increasingly distributed and complex, cybersecurity administrators struggle to protect users, data, applications, systems and networks from attacks. Layers upon layers of virtualization, containerization and fabric overlays create it difficult for security teams to properly view their network, identify threats and remediate them in a reasonable amount of time. Advanced security tools that incorporate AI and machine learning capabilities tout their ability to provide security clarity in first- and third-party infrastructures, as well as the various software-defined network layers. At the same time, confusion has mounted over the roles of security observability vs. visibility and monitoring. Some observe the three terms as interchangeable, but there are distinct differences that can affect how these security tools and processes interact. Monitoring alerts security teams Security monitoring tools were around for decades. A tool or a function within a larger monitoring toolset is typically configured by an IT security administrator to ingest various device or software logs, Simple Network Management Protocol polls and traps, event messages, NetFlow, packet capture and other streaming telemetry data. Triggers are usually set up, so when a security monitoring tool processes an event that matches a specific circumstance or meets a certain threshold, an alert is issued. This alert is fielded by IT security staff to identify whether it represents valid security threat, determine the root cause of the security incident and remediate the threat. Security monitoring may be done at the host, system, application or network level. But traditional security monitoring tools take a large amount of administrator time to hunt down and resolve an incident using manual processes. The problem is magnified as infrastructures become more complex and more monitoring data is collected. Additionally, security incidents often generate alerts sourced from multiple security monitoring tools. These duplicated alerts can lead to security monitoring fatigue. Observability provides intelligence and remediation Security observability can assist tackle monitoring fatigue. Observability platforms add intelligence to what is being monitored at a broad level to determine the true root cause of an alert and assist administrators properly remediate it. Advanced technologies such as AI, machine learning and automation assist centralize, correlate and create sense of all the alert-induced noise produced by outputs from individual security monitoring tools. Take a closer look at the security functions of observability: Verification of expected application performance. Performance thresholds may be set and will notify administrators when application performance dips below minimum levels. Behavior baselining and alerting when behavior veers from normal observations. Observability tools baseline normal infrastructure and traffic flow behavior and alert when that behavior deviates from a set threshold. AI-driven event and root cause analysis. AI can identify the specific hardware and software locations where an incident occurred and provide insights into how the issue is best resolved. Instead of reacting to infrastructure events that can cause application outages or performance issues, observability tools can identify areas of an infrastructure that should be addressed before any major incidents and outages occur. Network detection and response. NDR tools assist provide full visibility across the entire data security lifecycle , starting from security event identification all the way to event resolution. Visibility peels away the network layers It's crucial to think of security visibility not so much from a technology point of view, but rather from the perspective of IT security teams. Visibility is all about the reach and depth that the existing set of monitoring tools and observability architectures can provide to security administrators in an easily digestible format. Since networks are highly distributed, security visibility must be able to view all corners of the network under the purview of the enterprise -- the corporate LAN, WLAN and local data center, as well as remote sites across the WAN and private and public clouds. Potential lack of network security visibility, for example, was prevalent in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when employees were forced to vacate their offices and work from home. Security teams rushed to bolster their security monitoring and observability tools to increase visibility across the internet and at remote locations where users were accessing corporate applications and data. The security visibility plane enables IT to peel away each software layer until it reaches the base foundation of the infrastructure. Monitoring tools ingest health and security information from virtualized servers, containers and network overlays. Additional monitoring also occurs on the physical hardware and host operating systems that form the foundation of the virtualized software platforms. Different but equal To highlight the role of observability vs. visibility and monitoring tools, a typical conversation between two IT security administrators about ways to more quickly resolve triggered security events will likely begin at a granular level and broaden to a higher level. In this scenario, specific tools would first require to be deployed and configured to monitor parts of the infrastructure. The problem with these tools producing overlapping and redundant alerts would then be addressed as well as ways alerts may be sent to a centralized tool to be intelligently analyzed and perhaps correlated to a single security incident. Enter security observability. Monitoring and observability tools may be deployed in the LAN and data center, but what about public cloud scenarios ? That's where security visibility comes in. visibility and monitoring tools have distinct purposes yet play complementary roles in the overall enterprise security architecture.

================================================================================
In our last post “ Introducing the MantisNet CVF: Solving Cloud Native, Serverless, Observability Challenges “ we provided an overview of the Containerized Visibility Fabric (CVF) capabilities and made some assertions about how revolutionary and disruptive cloud-native technologies are, the resulting opacity problems, as well the art of the possible insofar as enabling next-generation observability. In this installment we’ll go into more detail as to what exactly we mean by cloud-native observability as well as the significance, deeper implications of it, interoperability and investment protection. So, let’s revisit containerization, and by extension, why cloud-native observability is so revolutionary. Containers In containerized environments, there is no intervening hypervisor between the OS and the underlying infrastructure. Consequently, it is possible to access and utilize operating system (and kernel) services directly to examine the state and operation of the underlying infrastructure (bare metal servers), as well as services, the operating system and applications. This is profoundly crucial because in the cloud-native world – as previously discussed; network topology (physical and virtual) is hidden interfaces (network namespaces) are hidden data flows are hidden. and to create matters even more challenging- resources are dynamically configured, provisioned, deployed and reused. Stated more clearly; cloud-native, serverless, compute environments, while representing the most scalable and performant way to exploit cloud infrastructure, these technologies obfuscate, or create highly difficult, the ability to observe, instrument and monitor the systems with legacy tools and technologies. The Significance of Real-time, Cloud Native Observability MantisNet CVF agents, deployed as microservices and containerized applications, uniquely exploit deep system and kernel level instrumentation, to instrument, access, collect and process the resulting telemetry - where the telemetry is generated (not a TAP or other location further up the network) - in such a way as to provide programmatic visibility and access to the underlying infrastructure enabling better, newer forms of observability and control. Having access down to the kernel for instrumentation provides an immutable data source for security and network or application performance management. These new forms of observability and control are manifested through deep system level access and interactive command and control communications via a distributed message bus architecture. Cloud native observability with CVF provides access to the systems, services and instrumentation hooks down to the kernel. The CVF agent process and packages the resulting data and publishes it, continuously and in real-time, using a distributed message bus architecture where external analytic tools and/or AI/ML workflows can analyze the resulting streaming metadata telemetry and create command-control decisions and responses back to the source, providing interactive observability and control of network activities. This approach provides a more reliable and scalable, cloud-native, way to dynamically inspect, extract and process detailed telemetry from the cloud-native infrastructure, to the kernel and data link layer, and serve it up continuously and in real-time via serialized metadata using a high-performance streaming messaging system (NATS, Kafka…). This enables deep visibility, flexibility and investment protection. Whereas legacy traffic acquisition and monitoring tools give you a tools interpretation of what is going on with your network based on activity, we’re giving you the telemetry data right from the generating source. Why is observability so crucial? There was a lot written about Observability recently. According to Wikipedia's Observability page , “In control theory, observability represents measure of how well internal states of a system may be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs. “Simply put, observability is achieved when data is made available from within the system that you wish to monitor. " " Monitoring is the actual task of collecting and displaying this data. ” In other words; observability provides richer, deeper and more useful knowledge and context for understanding what is happening within a system. So, observability requires that both the quality and utility of data (telemetry) obtained from the systems is sufficient to comprehend the system under observation; not constrained by what information is merely available. Conventional monitoring and visibility solutions have traditionally been a good source of information; they only provide static snapshots (data structures logs, PCAP files, traces…) obtained from pre-defined, available sources, or captured from monitoring applications or network traffic. Furthermore, with these legacy approaches, modifying the format or contents of those existing, predefined forms of telemetry could entail rewriting the application, or in some cases (specifically with a packet broker), requiring entirely new hardware. Visibility / Monitoring MantisNet Observability What information is available? What information do I require to comprehend the system? Best efforts monitoring Purposefully instrument Data-at-rest Continuous, streaming in real-time Static Programmatic / programmable The Deeper Implications of MantisNet Cloud Native Observability MantisNet takes cloud-native observability further. In cloud-native, serverless environments, the observational data needs to be continuous and adaptable as the systems evolve. The MantisNet CVF agents are sensor agent programs which are event driven and operate in secure confines of protected kernel space, meaning they are secure, resource efficient and have access to functions and services at the operating system (kernel) level and directly process the resulting telemetry up to the application layer. Additionally, and because CVF agents collect and process information where it is generated and may be loaded and launched on demand, CFV agent capabilities may be used how, when and where they are needed. The CVF is not just a sensor, although it can serve as a simple probe; capturing, filtering and replicating traffic, a form of a cloud-native TAP, but it is much more in terms of its utility, scalability, and flexibility as described in more detail on the MantisNet CVF page. MantisNet CVF agents also makes data correlation in cloud-native environments much, much simpler. The ability to generate the correct telemetry when and where it is needed as well as provide the ability to correlate CVF telemetry with other data sources not only supports more powerful analytic capabilities, but also provides you the ability to work with other forms of observability tools, telemetry, or semi-structured data within your overall operations analysis and monitoring practice. How do MantisNet solutions (specifically the CVF) compare to the latest observability tools? The answer is, it depends on what you desire to accomplish. If you desire to monitor the general health and status of process and applications, there represent raft of exciting new system tools available, many participating with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Transitioning to the Future: Interoperability and Investment Protection Outside of the benefits of cloud-native observability, a significant proportion of applications are not greenfield, they are hybrid environments that utilize a combination of stand-alone and virtualized infrastructure, and require the capabilities and type of telemetry that the MantisNet CVF can deliver. While pure-play cloud-native environments are growing, many organizations have significant commitments and investments in analytics and tools which can only utilize the more conventional data-at-rest sources (logs, files, NetFlow, IP-FIX, PCAP, DPI. To support those environments, the MantisNet CVF offers compatibility with the ability to stream both metadata and legacy formats (PCAP, DPI files, NetFlow, IP-FIX. ) into static file and data formats such that existing tools and applications (e. WireShark) can benefit from the richness, accuracy and immutability of CVF produced telemetry. Also, there are many applications for supporting regulatory compliance, legal, forensic, auditing, etc. , that by definition require the resulting traffic capture and telemetry to be collected and secured for later retrieval and analysis. Here too, the MantisNet CVF may be configured to stream the captured traffic and telemetry into data repositories; static storage, data lakes to better meet those requirements. MantisNet is uniquely focused on the value of networks and “ data-in-motion ”. We obsess on understanding the “fluid dynamics” of virtual and physical traffic flows and providing observability into the sources and movement of data within and across the infrastructure. Providing instrumentation to observe and analyze the sources of data, the flow of data as well as how it is consumed. Whereas other observability tools focus on the health and state of the infrastructure the MantisNet CVF platform enables users to examine the data

Blog / Cyber Resilience Charlie Bedell , Content Marketing Manager Illumio Editorial October 16, 2025 23 min. Observability: Context Matters More Than Ever in the Cloud Era For decades, cybersecurity success was measured by how much you can observe. Dashboards packed with metrics, traffic logs, alerts, and charts offered a sense of control, even if that control was mostly reactive. But visibility alone isn’t enough anymore. As environments stretch across sprawling hybrid and multi-cloud architectures, static visibility falls short. It can’t deliver the real-time, contextual insight security teams require to stay ahead of today’s fast-moving threats. Modern attacks don’t just hit the perimeter. They spread laterally, blend into normal traffic, and increasingly utilize AI to evade detection. To keep up, security teams require more than just a view of what’s happening. They require to comprehend what it means and what to do next. That’s where AI-powered observability comes in. It turns raw data into real insight and helps security teams shift from simply watching threats to actively stopping them. Why static visibility isn’t enough anymore Static visibility tools were designed for yesterday’s networks which were finite, contained, and predictable. But modern architectures are anything but static. They’re distributed across public cloud, on-premises, and edge systems, connected by APIs, and powered by workloads that spin up and down in seconds. In that world, static visibility leads to three dangerous blind spots: Context gaps. You can observe a workload but not its dependencies. You understand a port is open but not why. Every new data source means new logs and new noise but not necessarily new understanding. ‍ Delayed containment. Even if you detect a breach, you can’t respond fast enough without contextual insight into where it can spread. That’s why observability versus monitoring has become a crucial distinction. Monitoring tells you something happened. Observability helps you predict, prioritize, and act. observability: seeing isn’t the same as understanding Traditional network visibility tools focus on what’s known and measurable. They look at which systems exist, what traffic is flowing, and which alerts are triggered. Visibility answers what you can observe. But observability in cybersecurity answers why something is happening. Observability is dynamic, data-driven, and contextual. Instead of just collecting telemetry, observability uses AI and machine learning for threat detection, correlation, and reasoning. It transforms a sea of signals into a living, breathing map of your environment, complete with risk context, dependencies, and behavioral baselines. Put simply, static visibility shows you a list of symptoms, while AI-powered observability helps you diagnose the disease. That shift from visibility to observability marks a foundational evolution in modern security strategy. It’s redefining how organizations detect, contain, and respond to today’s breaches. What is AI-powered observability? At the heart of AI-powered observability is contextual insight, which is the ability to connect seemingly unrelated data points into a coherent picture of risk. AI security graphs play a critical role here. By mapping relationships between users, workloads, applications, and network flows, these graphs reveal how a single compromise could traverse your environment. Graph-based security analytics demonstrate how lateral movement could occur, not just if it’s happening. Think of AI observability as your real-time analyst: It learns behavioral patterns over time, identifying anomalies before they escalate. It correlates disparate data streams, from cloud telemetry to endpoint logs, into actionable intelligence. It drives AI-driven breach containment by understanding blast radius, exposure, and priority targets. This is AI-driven resilience in action, a smarter, faster, and more proactive form of defense. Predictive observability is the future of cyber resilience As environments grow more complex, the future of cybersecurity observability lies in prediction, not reaction. Predictive observability uses machine learning models trained on vast amounts of telemetry to forecast where risks are emerging and how attackers might exploit them. This evolution turns your network from a static map into a living model of your organization’s cyber terrain. It’s what enables next-generation breach response that’s fast, automated, and intelligent. The promise of intelligent threat visibility isn’t just seeing everything. It’s knowing which signals matter most and how to act in real time. Zero Trust needs AI observability You can’t enforce Zero Trust without first understanding your environment. Observability provides that foundation by uncovering how every entity communicates, authenticates, and behaves. When paired with microsegmentation and observability, organizations can enforce least-privilege policies with precision. Instead of static rules, Zero Trust observability enables adaptive controls that respond dynamically to changes in risk posture. For example: Lateral movement detection highlights suspicious east-west traffic. Contextual security insights determine whether that behavior aligns with policy. Automated incident response can isolate or quarantine affected systems before damage spreads. This is the essence of Zero Trust breach response, real-time containment driven by insight, not guesswork. Context is king: why AI must power security decisions Context has always been the missing piece in cybersecurity. Logs, alerts, and metrics tell you what happened, but they rarely elaborate on why it matters. That’s why AI contextual reasoning in security is so transformative. It’s what allows defenders to move from reactive detection to predictive observability, anticipating threats before they manifest. With behavioral analytics in cybersecurity, AI can spot subtle deviations, such as a workload communicating with a system it never has before or an access pattern that defies baseline norms. And with AI-driven threat prioritization, teams can focus on what truly matters instead of drowning in alerts that don’t. The result is proactive cybersecurity with AI that reduces mean time to detect (MTTD) and respond (MTTR), making breach containment simpler and faster. AI reimagines breach containment Most breaches aren’t catastrophic because of the initial intrusion. They’re catastrophic because of the spread. Once an attacker moves laterally, traditional defenses struggle to keep up. AI-powered observability changes that by illuminating the entire attack path. It shows: Which assets are exposed Which pathways are exploitable Which systems are connected to your crown jewels This intelligence makes breach containment strategies far more effective. Instead of chasing alerts, defenders can immediately contain lateral movement using pre-defined segmentation policies informed by AI insights. In short, AI breach containment replaces firefighting with foresight. How Illumio Insights makes observability actionable Illumio Insights delivers observability based on an AI security graph.
