Deny access to this computer from the network Feedback Summarize this article for me Applies to Windows 11 Windows 10 Describes the best practices, location, values, policy management, and security considerations for the Deny access to this computer from the network security policy setting. Reference This security setting determines which users are prevented from accessing a device over the network. Constant: SeDenyNetworkLogonRight Possible values User-defined list of accounts Guest Best practices Because all Active Directory Domain Services programs utilize a network logon for access, utilize caution when you assign this user right on domain controllers. Location Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignment Default values By default, this setting is Guest on domain controllers and on stand-alone servers. The following table lists the actual and effective default policy values. Default values are also listed on the policy’s property page.

A restart of the device isn't required for this policy setting to be effective. This policy setting supersedes the Access this computer from the network policy setting if a user account is subject to both policies. Any change to the user rights assignment for an account becomes effective the next time the owner of the account logs on. Group Policy Settings are applied in the following order through a Group Policy Object (GPO), which will overwrite settings on the local computer at the next Group Policy update: Local policy settings Site policy settings Domain policy settings OU policy settings When a local setting is greyed out, it indicates that a GPO currently controls that setting. Security considerations This section describes how an attacker might exploit a feature or its configuration, how to implement the countermeasure, and the possible negative consequences of countermeasure implementation. Vulnerability Users who can sign in to the device over the network can enumerate lists of account names, group names, and shared resources. Users with permission to access shared folders and files can connect over the network and possibly view or modify data. Countermeasure Assign the Deny access to this computer from the network user right to the following accounts: Anonymous sign in Built-in local Administrator account Local Guest account All service accounts An crucial exception to this list is any service accounts that are used to begin services that must connect to the device over the network. For example, let’s say you've configured a shared folder for web servers to access, and you present content within that folder through a website. You may require to allow the account that runs IIS to sign in to the server with the shared folder from the network. This user right is effective when you must configure servers and workstations on which sensitive information is handled because of regulatory compliance concerns. Note If the service account is configured in the logon properties of a Windows service, it requires network logon rights to the domain controllers to begin properly. Potential impact If you configure the Deny access to this computer from the network user right for other accounts, you could limit the abilities of users who are assigned to specific administrative roles in your environment. You should verify that delegated tasks aren't negatively affected. Related topics User Rights Assignment Additional resources Last updated on 2021-05-19

Windows OS Hub / Windows Server 2016 / Windows: Block Remote Network Access for Local User Accounts February 27, 2023 Windows: Block Remote Network Access for Local User Accounts Using local accounts (including the local administrator) to access another computer over network in Active Directory environments is not recommended on a number of reasons. The same local administrator username and password are often used on many computers, which can put multiple devices at risk if a single computer is compromised ( Pass-the-hash attack threat). Moreover, access to the network resources with local accounts is hard to personify and centrally monitor, because such events are not logged on AD domain controllers. To mitigate the risk, administrators can rename the default local Windows Administrator account. To regularly change the local administrator password on all computers in the domain, you can utilize the MS LAPS tool ( Local Administrator Password Solution ). But these solutions won’t be able to solve the problem of restricting network access for all local user accounts, since there may be more than one local account on a computer. You can restrict network access for local accounts using the Deny access to this computer from the network policy. But this policy requires to explicitly list all accounts that require to be denied network access to the computer. 1 and Windows Server 2012 R2, two new well-known security groups with new SIDs appeared. One includes all local users, and the second includes all local administrators. S-1-5-113 NT AUTHORITY\Local account All local accounts S-1-5-114 NT AUTHORITY\Local account and member of Administrators group All local accounts with the administrator privileges Now, to restrict access for local accounts, you can utilize their common SIDs. These groups are added to the user’s access token during logon to the computer under a local account. To create sure that in Windows 10/Windows Server 2016 your local administrator account is assigned two new security groups ( NT AUTHORITY\Local account (SID S-1-5-113) and N T AUTHORITY\Local account and member of Administrators group (SID S-1-5-114) ), run the command: Whoami /all You can utilize these built-in local security groups on Windows 7/ 8 and Windows Server 2008 R2/ Windows Server 2012 after installing update KB 2871997 (June 2014). You can check if these security groups exist on your Windows device by SID using the following PowerShell script: $objSID = New-Object System. SecurityIdentifier ("S-1-5-113") $objAccount = $objSID. NTAccount]) $objAccount. Value If the script returns NT Authority\Local account , then this local group (with S-1-5-113 SID) exists on your computer. In order to block the remote network access under local user accounts containing these SIDs in the token, you can utilize the settings from the GPO section Computer Configuration -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings -> Local Policies -> User Rights Assignment. Deny Remote Desktop (RDP) Access for Local Users and Administrators The Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services policy allows you to specify users and groups that are explicitly denied to logon to a computer remotely via Remote Desktop. You can deny RDP access to the computer for local and domain accounts. By default, RDP access on Windows is allowed for the administrators and members of the local Remote Desktop User group. If you desire to restrict RDP connections for local users only (including local administrators), open the local GPO editor gpedit. msc (if you desire to apply these settings on computers in the Active Directory domain, utilize the domain Group Policy Editor – gpmc. Go to the GPO section User Rights Assignment and edit the Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services policy. Add the built-in local security groups “Local account and member of Administrators group” and “Local account” to the policy. Update local Group Policy settings using the command: gpupdate /force. The deny policy takes precedence over the Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services policy. If a user or group is added in both policies, RDP access for that user shall be denied. Now, if you attempt to connect to your computer under local user via RDP, an error will appear: To sign in remotely, you require the right to sign in through Remote Desktop Services. By default, members of the Remote Desktop Users group have this right. If the group you’re in doesn’t have this right, or if the right was removed from the Remote Desktop Users group, you require to be granted this right manually. Deny Access to Computer from the Network You can deny network access to a computer under local credentials with the Deny access to this computer from the network policy. Add the local groups “ Local account” and “ Local account and member of Administrators group” to the Deny access to this computer from the network policy. Also, you should always deny anonymous access and access under a guest account. For a domain environment, we recommend that you utilize the Deny access to this computer from the network policy to completely block access to workstations and domain-member servers under accounts from the Domain Admins and Enterprise Admins security groups. These accounts should only be used to access domain controllers. This will reduce the risks of capturing the administrative (privileged) account hash and privilege escalation. After applying the policy, you won’t be able to remotely connect to this computer over the network under any local Windows account. When trying to connect to a shared network folder or map a network drive from this computer under a local account, an error will appear: Microsoft Windows Network: Logon failure: the user has not been granted the requested logon type at this computers. When trying to establish a Remote Desktop connection under the local administrator account (. \administrator ), an error message appears. The system administrator has restricted the types of logon (network or interactive) that you may utilize. For assistance, contact your system administrator or technical support. If you apply this policy to a computer that is part of a Windows workgroup (not j oined to an Active Directory domain ), you can only logon to that computer locally. Deny Users to Sign in Locally to Windows 10 Using the Deny log on locally policy, you can also restrict interactive logins to the computer/server under local Windows accounts. Go to the GPO User Rights Assignment section, edit the Deny log on locally policy. Add the required local security group to it. Be especially careful with deny Group Policy settings. If configured incorrectly, you may lose access to computers. As a last resort, you can reset your local GPO settings like this. Now, if a user or administrator tries to logon to the computer under a local account, a message will appear. The sign-in method you are trying to utilize isn’t allowed. For more info, contact your network administrator. The same message will appear if you have restricted the list of computers allowed to login in the user account settings in AD. Thus, you can deny network access under local Windows accounts to computers and domain-member servers, and increase the security of the corporate environment. 8 comments 6 Facebook Twitter Google + Pinterest Active Directory Group Policies Windows 10 Windows Server 2016 previous post Zabbix Installation and Basic Configuration Guide next post How to Disable or Change User Account Control (UAC) Settings in Windows Related Reading Fixing “Winload. efi is Missing or Contains Errors” in.

Reply sasa December 2, 2020 - 8:22 pm What if I desire to allow only local administrator (i. RID-500 account) to logon over network and to deny logon over network to all other local (and local only) accounts ? There is no SID for “every local account but RID-500 admin” so I presume it is not an easy job to do.

Audit Deprecated This audit was deprecated and shall be removed in a future update. View Next Audit Version Information This policy setting prohibits users from connecting to a computer from across the network, which would allow users to access and potentially modify data remotely. In high security environments, there should be no require for remote users to access data on a computer. Instead, file sharing should be accomplished through the utilize of network servers. This user right supersedes the Access this computer from the network user right if an account is subject to both policies. The recommended state for this setting is to include: Guests, Local account. Caution: Configuring a standalone (non-domain-joined) workstation as described above may result in an inability to remotely administer the workstation. Note: The security identifier Local account is not available in Windows 7 and Windows 8. 0 unless MSKB 2871997 was installed. Rationale: Users who can log on to the computer over the network can enumerate lists of account names, group names, and shared resources. Users with permission to access shared folders and files can connect over the network and possibly view or modify data. Impact: If you configure the Deny access to this computer from the network user right for other groups, you could limit the abilities of users who are assigned to specific administrative roles in your environment. You should verify that delegated tasks will not be negatively affected. Solution To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Device Configuration Policy to Guests, Local account: To access the Device Configuration Policy from the Intune Home page: Click Devices Click Configuration profiles Click Create profile Select the platform (Windows 10 and later) Select the profile (Endpoint protection) Click Create Enter a Name Click Next Configure the following Setting Path: Endpoint protection/User Rights Setting Name: Deny Access From Network Configuration: Allow and sub-option: Guests, Local account Select OK Continue through the Wizard to complete the creation of the profile (profile assignments, applicability etc. ) Note: More than one configuration setting from each of the Configuration profiles (ex: Administrative Templates, Custom etc. ) may be added to each Device Configuration Policy. Note #2: This setting can also be created via a Custom Configuration Profile using the following OMA-URI: Name: <Enter name> Description: <Enter Description> OMA-URI:. /Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/UserRights/DenyAccessFromNetwork Data type: String Value: Guests, Local account crucial: When there is more than one value that needs to be entered (ex: Guests, Administrator), the XML value of &#61440; will require to be converted to its Unicode character representation to separate the values in the Value field of the Custom Device Configuration Policy. This value should convert to a square with a question mark in it (). Please note that when copied from the converter to Intune a square will appear, but the value will still work. Also note that this value cannot be copied from sources like Microsoft Word. We recommend that the value be copied and used directly from the converter. A sample converter may be found at Online XML entity decoder | Coder's Toolbox.

The Deny access to this computer from the network user right on workstations must be configured to prevent access from highly privileged domain accounts and local accounts on domain systems and unauthenticated access on all systems. Overview Finding ID Version Rule ID IA Controls Severity V-220968 WN10-UR-000070 SV-220968r958472_rule CCI-000213 medium Description Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities. The "Deny access to this computer from the network" right defines the accounts that are prevented from logging on from the network. In an Active Directory Domain, denying logons to the Enterprise Admins and Domain Admins groups on lower trust systems helps mitigate the risk of privilege escalation from credential theft attacks, which could lead to the compromise of an entire domain. Local accounts on domain-joined systems must also be assigned this right to decrease the risk of lateral movement resulting from credential theft attacks. The Guests group must be assigned this right to prevent unauthenticated access.

Microsoft Security Baselines Blog 3 MIN READ Blocking Remote utilize of Local Accounts Aaron Margosis Former Employee Jun 18, 2019 First published on TechNet on Sep 02, 2014 The utilize of local accounts for remote access in Active Directory environments is problematic for a number of reasons. By far, the biggest problem is that when an administrative local account has the same user name and password on multiple machines, an attacker with administrative rights on one machine can easily obtain the account’s password hash from the local Security Accounts Manager (SAM) database and utilize it to gain administrative rights over the other machines using “pass the hash” techniques. Our latest security guidance responds to these problems by taking advantage of new Windows features to block remote logons by local accounts. 1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 introduced two new security identifiers (SIDs), which are also defined on Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2012 after installing KB 2871997 : S-1-5-113: NT AUTHORITY\Local account S-1-5-114: NT AUTHORITY\Local account and member of Administrators group The former SID is added to the user’s access token at the time of logon if the user account being authenticated represents local account. The latter SID is also added to the token if the local account represents member of the BUILTIN\Administrators group. These SIDs can grant or deny access to all local accounts or all administrative local accounts – for example, in User Rights Assignments to “Deny access to this computer from the network” and “Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services”, as we recommend in our latest security guidance. Prior to the definition of these SIDs, you would have had to explicitly name each local account to be restricted to achieve the same effect. In the initial release of the Windows 8. 1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 guidance, we denied network and remote desktop logon to “Local account” (S-1-5-113) for all Windows client and server configurations, which blocks all remote access for all local accounts. We have since discovered that Failover Clustering relies on a non-administrative local account (CLIUSR) for cluster node management and that blocking its network logon access causes cluster services to fail. Because the CLIUSR account is not a member of the Administrators group, replacing S-1-5-113 with S-1-5-114 in the “Deny access to this computer from the network” setting allows cluster services to work correctly while still providing protection against “pass the hash” types of attacks by denying network logon to administrative local accounts. While we could keep the guidance as it is and add a “special case” footnote for failover cluster scenarios, we will instead opt to simplify deployments and change the Windows Server 2012 R2 Member Server baseline as follows: Policy Path Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignment Policy Name Deny access to this computer from the network Original Value Guests, Local account (*) New Value Guests, Local account and member of Administrators group (*) (*) The guidance also recommends adding Domain Admins and Enterprise Admins to these restrictions except on domain controllers and dedicated admin workstations. DA and EA are domain-specific and can’t be specified in generic GPO baselines. Note that this change applies only to the Member Server baseline and that the restriction on remote desktop logon is not being changed. Organizations can still choose to deny network access to “Local account” for non-clustered servers. Note also that the restrictions on local accounts are intended for Active Directory domain-joined systems. Non-joined, workgroup Windows computers cannot authenticate domain accounts, so if you apply restrictions against remote utilize of local accounts on these systems, you shall be able to log on only at the console.
