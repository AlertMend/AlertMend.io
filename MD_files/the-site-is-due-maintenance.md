If you have to take a site offline for planned maintenance, we recommend properly announcing ahead of time and making it clear: What you’re doing Why you’re doing it What’s the estimated time range We recommend a tool like Statuspage for announcing scheduled maintenance and providing updates along the way. This is especially helpful if your maintenance extends beyond your estimated duration, in which you’ll definitely desire give your audience more context and periodic updates. Unfortunately, many full-blown outages begin out as routine maintenance. What represents maintenance page? A maintenance page represents temporary placeholder for times when a site or app needs to be taken offline for updates, backups or maintenance. It tells the visitor that the site they’re trying to reach is temporarily unavailable because the team behind the scenes is doing some work. It’s not a crime scene, just a temporary construction zone. Wait, isn’t that an error page? Not exactly. Error pages surface when a visitor is able to locate the server, but not the specific destination. Broken links or crashed servers can cause an error page. Maintenance pages are intentional. The infrastructure team knows the site needs to go offline, so they put up a temporary maintenance page in its place. But like we mentioned earlier, sometimes outages begin with routine maintenance. It’s good to be prepared for both. A note on zero downtime maintenance Maintenance pages might feel a little like a stroll down memory lane. Or maybe you can’t even remember the last time you encountered one. Blame/thank advances in zero downtime maintenance.

Keep it helpful and simple While fun branding is always more exciting than a dull page, don’t mince words or attempt to obtain too cute with your copy. The phrase “maintenance” or “down for maintenance” should be truly prominent somewhere. Otherwise you risk visitors getting confused. Confused visitors can turn into angry social media blast enemies truly quickly. Don’t let that happen. Twitter Who can forget the fail whale.

This represents clever illustration that communicates the “work in progress” effect of maintenance periods. Have some fun Tip 2 doesn’t mean you have to be totally serious. After all, this page represents chance to experiment and attempt a design or theme you might not deem ripe for your main site just yet. Just don’t obtain too crazy. Google Wave Google Wave was announced in 2009 as a revolutionary new communciation platform. The project was a service full of surprises, not the least of which being its highly short lifespan. Another quirk to the Wave nostalgia is this maintenance page. The silly copy and full-screen illustration seem highly non-Googly today. Wave’s been retired for the better part of a decade now, so consider this an internet artifact. Investopedia What’s a credit default swap? How does GAAP compliance work? Pick any finance or accounting term, there’s a chance Investopedia has a great page explaining it. It makes sense that thier maintenance page includes this clever explanation of maintenence pages. Think about other things your maintenance page can do for you Sometimes a maintenance page can assist with objectives beyond announcing maintenance. Like building anticipation for an update or new product, highlighting customers, or showcasing community content. Apple Apple is known for putting up a page like this when they’re in the midst of one of their famous product launch events.

Adding a reason phrased as a benefit is another great touch: “We’re performing a database upgrade in order to increase page load speed. ” Whatever you’re reason, please don’t create one up. Give visitors a call to action You can’t control what visitors do after they observe your maintenance page. But you can certainly create a suggestion. Consider a call to action, a link to other helpful content you provide (just be sure it’s not offline!) or a signup form for an email list. A link to your social media accounts, for example. utilize the moment to attempt to keep some of those visitors engaged.

Home Search Central Google Search Central Blog Send feedback How to deal with planned site downtime Tuesday, January 25, 2011 Once in a while we obtain asked whether a site's visibility in Google's search results may be impacted in a negative way if it's unavailable when Googlebot tries to crawl it. Sometimes downtime is unavoidable: a site owner might decide to take a site down due to ongoing site maintenance, or legal or cultural requirements. Outages that are not clearly marked as such can negatively affect a site's reputation. While we cannot guarantee any crawling, indexing or ranking, there are methods to deal with planned website downtime in a way that will generally not negatively affect your site's visibility in the search results. For example, instead of returning an HTTP result code 404 (Not Found) or showing an error page with the status code 200 (OK) when a page is requested, it's better to return a 503 HTTP result code (Service Unavailable) which tells search engine crawlers that the downtime is temporary. Moreover, it allows site owners to provide visitors and bots with an estimated time when the site shall be up and running again. If known, the length of the downtime in seconds or the estimated date and time when the downtime shall be complete may be specified in an optional Retry-After header , which Googlebot may utilize to determine when to recrawl the URL. Returning a 503 HTTP result code may be a great solution for a number of other situations. We encounter a lot of problems with sites that return 200 (OK) result codes for server errors, downtime, bandwidth-overruns or for temporary placeholder pages ("Under Construction"). The 503 HTTP result code is the site owner's solution of choice for all these situations. As for planned server downtime like hardware maintenance, it's a good idea to have a separate server available to actually return the 503 HTTP result code. It is crucial, however, to not treat 503 as a permanent solution: lasting 503 HTTP result codes can eventually be seen as a sign that the server is now permanently unavailable and can result in us removing URLs from Google's index. If you set up a 503 (Service Unavailable) response, the header information might look like this when using PHP: header('HTTP/1. 1 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable'); header('Retry-After: Sat, 8 Oct 2011 18:27:00 GMT'); Similar to how you can create 404 pages more useful to users , it's also a good idea to provide a customized 503 message explaining the situation to users and letting them understand when the site shall be available again. For further information regarding HTTP result codes, please observe RFC 2616. Posted by Tomer Honen and Kaspar Szymanski , Search Quality Team, Dublin Send feedback

Maintenance mode for a website Feedback Summarize this article for me There might be times when your website is under scheduled maintenance or is down because of temporary outage. When a customer accesses the website during maintenance, unpredictable behavior and intermittent unavailability might be experienced. As a website administrator, you can configure your site to display a proper message to customers whenever a maintenance activity is going on (for example, "Solution packages are being upgraded. ") You can benefit from this capability by enabling the maintenance mode on your website. When the maintenance mode is enabled, a message is displayed, and the customers are restricted from browsing any webpages except the <website URL>/_services/about page. Enable maintenance mode You can enable maintenance mode on your website to provide a consistent message, instead of dealing with unpredictable behavior when your website is under scheduled maintenance. This capability will provide a better experience for your users. Open the Power Platform admin center. In the Resources section, select Power Pages sites. Select the site for which you desire to enable maintenance mode, select Manage from the main menu. Select Site Actions and then Enable maintenance mode. In the Enable maintenance mode panel, enter the following values: Select page to be used when maintenance mode is enabled : Select one of the following values: Default page : Select this value if you desire the default page to be displayed when maintenance mode is enabled. By default, this option is selected. Custom page : Select this value if you desire a custom HTML page to be displayed when maintenance mode is enabled. Custom page URL : This field is enabled only when you select the option to display a custom HTML page. crucial Read the custom maintenance page considerations before using custom maintenance page. While maintenance mode is being enabled, the website restarts and is unavailable for a few minutes. Considerations for custom maintenance page Ensure the page URL you provide is publicly accessible. The custom maintenance page uses IFrame to display the page. So, the page shouldn't contain the x-frame-options:SAMEORIGIN response header, else the page won't load. Don't host custom maintenance page on a Power Pages site. If a website is unavailable (for reasons such as data migration, solution upgrade, an outage, or any other maintenance activity), the custom maintenance page hosted on the same website won't be accessible. If the custom maintenance page is inaccessible publicly, or if you host the page on a Power Pages site where custom maintenance mode is enabled, the default maintenance page is used instead. The page also shows the following note for the administrators: Note for administrators: The custom page for maintenance mode could not be displayed due to configuration errors. Configure or disable maintenance mode After enabling maintenance mode for your website, you can update the maintenance mode settings and choose a different page. You can also choose to disable maintenance mode on your website when the scheduled maintenance of your website is complete. Your users can now browse and access all web pages as usual. Open the Power Platform admin center. In the Resources section, select Power Pages sites. Select the site for which you desire to disable or update maintenance mode, select Manage from the main menu. Select Site Actions and then Configure or Disable maintenance mode. Modify the settings as required, and select Update. For example, you might choose to display the default page if you've selected to display the custom page earlier. To disable maintenance mode, select Disable. While maintenance mode is being updated or disabled, the website restarts and is unavailable for a few minutes. observe also Power Pages maintenance and troubleshooting Feedback Was this page helpful?
