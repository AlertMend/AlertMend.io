As you might imagine, having a lot of options may be just as bad as having but a few. It begs the question of how do you pick one. The truth is that there’s no clear answer and it’s going to be mostly based on your particular needs. Here’s what you should consider when on the market for a synthetic monitoring solution: Do you desire an open source tool or a SaaS? How many monitors would you like to run and how often? What type of budget do you have? Will you require additional services like a real user monitoring tool or log management software ? It’s easy enough to focus on one product that solves your require but do debug your issues. You’ll probably require to obtain a solution for real user monitoring, log management, and infrastructure monitoring. This means that if you are using a single product solution, you’ll have to look somewhere else for these, having you spend more time and money on this. How many people in your organization will utilize the application? Some solutions will charge you for every extra seat at the table and the price can go exponentially higher if you happen to have large teams. How often do you plan on running your tests? How complex are they going to be? How many testing locations would you require and in what regions? Do you require to look behind a firewall or not? One thing in particular I recommend you should pay special attention to – whether you’ll require additional services or not. For instance, if your utilize case requires log monitoring and infrastructure monitoring , the list shall be significantly smaller. And this in particular is not a small task. Having the ability to observe exactly the error that the server recorded when the issue was reported is going to save your team hours and hours of debugging. How about RUM? Real user monitoring allows you to record the interactions of your actual users while synthetic monitoring will simulate them. It might not be obvious right now, but combining the two will remove all the blind spots that you might have if you choose to utilize just one without the other. We explained the full benefits in our article about real user monitoring vs synthetic monitoring , so create sure to check that one out as well. All of these questions, among many others, will play a major role in how you choose the best synthetic tool to monitor and test your website. Sematext Cloud was built with all of these in mind.

Conclusion By now it should be painfully obvious that you require a synthetic monitoring solution to ensure the same top-notch experience for your users in China, the US, Europe, or any other corner of the world, regardless if it’s day or night. Picking one tool over another requires a formula that cannot be universally applied to every company so it will come down to your individual needs. If you have small individual teams and you understand that only one will utilize a particular solution it’s probably fine to obtain a single product solution. But more often than not, unless you already have an infrastructure monitoring tool that you are comfortable with, you’ll desire to obtain both.

Why Selenium is the “Best Open Source Tool” for Automation Testing? Why Selenium is the “Best Open Source Tool” for Automation Testing Technology has provided us with options, but most of the options are not sustainable! They live for a shorter duration and then turn to history! Today technology needs to be unlimited, unconditional, Adaptive to change and seamless, could you think of any tools/technologies that are progressive and stable for more than a decade? We have… Selenium – A Solid begin later caught up with Hiccups Jason Huggins who was working with ThoughtWorks was testing an internal application when doing the same thing made him realize, he needs a tool that could reduce manual efforts. He created a Javascript library that later became as Selenium Core and is the base of Selenium Remote Control [RC] and Selenium IDE. Selenium RC was a storm as it allowed you to control a browser with a software language of user’s choice! However, the hurricane was obstructed by web apps and the fundamental nature of Selenium based on javascript causing security issues. Simon in Google thought of challenging these limitations and created WebDriver, that was just a perfect solution to Selenium limitations. The brilliant minds gave Automation industry a magic wand with the merging of Webdriver and Selenium in 2008 to provide a standard set of features for all users. Simon the creator of webdriver says – “Why are the projects merging? Partly because WebDriver addresses some shortcomings in selenium (by being able to bypass the JS sandbox, for example. And we’ve got a gorgeous API), partly because selenium addresses some shortcomings in WebDriver (such as supporting a broader range of browsers) and partly because the main selenium contributors and I felt that it was the best way to offer users the best possible framework. ” Selenium – The Journey A Quick Glance on what were the different versions of Selenium – Selenium Version Features/Description Selenium Remote Control [Selenium RC] The basic version that was started, however, this is no longer active and used.

In this article, we outline how can small QA teams create transition from manual to codeless testing to full fledged automated testing. Why you can’t ignore test planning in agile? An agile development process seems too dynamic to have a test plan. Most organisations with agile, specially startups, don’t take the documented approach for testing. So, are they losing on something? Challenges of testing Single Page Applications with Selenium Single-page web applications are popular for their ability to improve the user experience. Except, test automation for Single-page apps may be difficult and time-consuming. We’ll discuss how you can have a steady quality control without burning time and effort. Why is Codeless Test Automation better than Conventional Test Automation? Testing is crucial for quality user experience.
