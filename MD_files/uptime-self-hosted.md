"VPS" stands for virtual private server, and means a virtual software instance running within a physical computer server. A virtual private server works like a dedicated physical server but relies on a virtualized software engine referred to as a "hypervisor" to provide the interface between the physical server and the virtual instance (aka "vps"). Why do I desire a VPS? By choosing a "VPS" you are using a sliver of a physical dedicated server, which means lower costs, because you are only utilizing a piece of the physical capacities of the underlying server. Additionally, VPS plans often provide easy migration from location to location and server to server along with being able to upgrade or downgrade your resources with only a few clicks (rather than having to change physical server components).

It only works as long as your server works. Which means: ❌ No alerts if the entire server is offline ❌ No geo-distributed checks ❌ No SLA reports or compliance features ❌ No multi-tenant team management ❌ No support, no guarantees, no roadmap ❌ No easy public status pages or incident comms ✅ The Better Alternative: Garmingo Status If you require real monitoring that: 🌍 Checks from multiple global locations 📈 Tracks uptime history & SLA targets 🧾 Generates automated PDF reports 🔐 Supports compliance & access control 💬 Offers status pages (public or private) 📣 Sends alerts via Slack, Email, Telegram, Webhooks, etc. 🙌 Has a responsive support team & active roadmap 💡 Stays online even when your infra crashes Then Garmingo Status is the better choice — full cease.
