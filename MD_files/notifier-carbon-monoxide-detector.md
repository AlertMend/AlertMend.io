Carbon monoxide detector are simple devices that more and more US states require in dwellings. They look like traditional smoke detectors and have a microprocessor that sends signals when CO gas is detected and sets off a shrill alarm when that happens. Some have LED lights that indicate battery status. Some are smart and may be linked to smartphones that alert you if they detect issues and notify the appropriate technicians. When inhaled, carbon monoxide binds tightly to hemoglobin, or red blood cells, to form carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), which depletes the body of oxygen and slowly poisons it. People can’t observe, smell or taste CO, so they don’t realize it’s in the air until they begin to feel nausea, headache and dizziness, and the symptoms obtain worse. The hazard of poisoning from CO exposure is especially dangerous for infants and seniors, as well as anyone with respiratory or heart conditions. Carbon Monoxide Detectors: Your Lifesaving Guardian Against the Silent Killer Carbon monoxide detectors have different methods to gauge the presence of the deadly odorless and tasteless gas, but they all work by detecting CO molecules in the air. Some are sensitive to changes in humidity, temperature and airflow and give off a warning at the precise moment CO concentrations reach dangerously high levels. Other designs utilize an electrochemical sensor that consists of two electrodes, a container and an electrolyte such as sulfuric acid to produce current when CO molecules touch them. This sensor is stable against humidity and temperature fluctuations and has a highly low false alarm rate

Kevin Warnock Entrepreneurship, ideas and more Archive for the ‘carbon monoxide detector’ tag Motorized vehicles should contain factory installed carbon monoxide and smoke detectors without comments All motorized vehicles, including cars, boats, ships, trucks, buses, planes and trains should come equipped from the factory with integrated carbon monoxide and smoke detectors. Vehicles should contain carbon monoxide and smoke detectors because power trains can fail and sometimes deliver deadly carbon monoxide into the passenger compartment, killing everyone inside. This happened yesterday, April 1, 2013, when three men got stuck in some mud while driving their sports utility vehicle in the early morning dark. One of the passengers, Shain Gandee , was famous for his starring role in the Music Television reality demonstrate Buckwild. The coroner ruled the deaths accidental and declared carbon monoxide poisoning to be the cause of death. The mud reportedly covered the muffler of the truck. That may have forced exhaust through holes in the exhaust system underneath the passenger area, and perhaps some of that exhaust infiltrated into the cabin. The truck was an old model that looks like it’s had a rough life. It was probably cold and dark out, and I can observe the three wanting to stay inside with the motor running to stay warm until daylight. Had there been a carbon monoxide detector on board, the three would were warned of the danger they were in, and could have shut off the engine and stepped outside for some fresh air. Better to be cold than dead. Even electric vehicles should have smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, since batteries also are dangerous. Additionally, people might utilize propane heaters inside, and they emit carbon monoxide that can kill you when they are malfunctioning. Detectors should be hard wired to the vehicle begin battery, but should have 10 year on board battery backup as well , like all detectors should. Detector design should be standardized so a detector from a Rolls Royce Phantom will fit a Chevrolet Aveo, and vice versa. That way the cost to replace detectors at the end of their life shall be low enough that people shall be inclined to do so. There should be an interlock so the car won’t drive past 55 miles per hour unless a working and non expired detector is installed. This will more than gently nudge owners to replace expired or defective detectors. A red light on the dash is not sufficient reminder. Making the car not begin is too extreme, since a user might be in danger if they got stranded. A speed limit represents powerful incentive. A detector like I propose here should cost about USD $10. 00 in quantity with the standardization I propose. I am sure Gandee’s family would have loved for him to have had a detector. In the meantime, before my idea gets implemented on a universal scale, go buy a home style smoke and carbon monoxide detector and install it in your vehicle. If it goes off and saves your life, please tell me so in a comment so I understand that people are reading this and acting upon my advice. I don’t understand how many unintentional carbon monoxide poisonings inside vehicles occur each year, but the number must be in the hundreds worldwide. An extra $10 to avoid these deaths is worth it. Written by Kevin Warnock April 2nd, 2013 at 3:24 pm Posted in Ideas Tagged with Buckwild , carbon monoxide detector , MTV , Music Television , Shain Gandee , smoke detector Smoke, fire and carbon monoxide detectors should chirp to signal low battery condition only during waking hours – here is how without comments Jeff Clavier, left, August 30, 2012, at Berkeley Entrepreneurs Forum at University of California Berkeley I have learned that smoke and fire detectors almost always signal low battery condition in the early morning between midnight and five o’clock. This wakes me up and forces me to replace batteries when I am sleepy. I suspect many people don’t have spare batteries always on hand like I do, and simply take the batteries out until they can go to the store. This leaves the premises less well protected, and I suspect fires have started during this period and that people have died. The fix is so simple I can’t believe I only thought of it today. Simply include a clock in all battery operated smoke, fire and carbon monoxide detectors. Have this clock powered by its own battery that can last a decade or more. Set this clock at the factory for the part of the world where the detectors shall be sold. The low battery circuitry should consult this on board clock, and should suppress the chirping ‘low battery’ notification during typical sleeping hours, say from 10pm to 8am. The chirping can resume at 8am each day until the batteries are replaced. Alarms typically will chirp for months before they run out of power entirely, so the delay in chirping during the night will not cause a significant safety issue. The clock should be user resettable so the detector may be moved between time zones by the buyer, or set to accommodate unusual sleep schedules. I suspect the clock I am proposing costs no more than USD $. 50 in bulk, and the feature that it will enable may be promoted to boost sales. I suspect such a detector will sell well because I suspect everyone with a detector was awakened by their chirping. Chirping during waking hours is likely to be a measurable advance in fire and poisoning safety, since awake and alert people are less likely to create mistakes, like removing the batteries or putting in replacement batteries backwards. Jeff Clavier's Facebook Wall as of March 22, 2013 While the circuit designers are at it, they should program the detectors to keep track of the passing years and notify the user when the detector has reached its end of life, around ten years after manufacture. I am sure there are millions of ‘expired’ detectors still in utilize because people forget when to replace them. This is my second post on how to improve detectors. My first post Smoke detectors should send activation warnings via text messages via Wi-Fi I wrote July 23, 2011. I believe detectors chirp now early in the morning because batteries deliver less power when cold, and in many homes the temperature drops lowest early in the morning. Here’s a post by The San Diego Real Estate Inspection Company that agrees with me. Thank you to SoftTech VC venture capitalist Jeff Clavier for sparking my imagination today to think up this fix. Clavier asked on Facebook this morning why detectors report low batteries exclusively at 3:30am. It’s then that I thought of including an internal clock to solve the problem. I posted my suggestion in a comment on Clavier’s Facebook Wall, and then decided to write this post to formalize my suggestion, with the hope the idea gets discovered and implemented. If this idea makes money for you or your company, please send me an industry average royalty for using this, out of the goodness of your heart. I am guessing that will amount to about USD $. 05 per detector, but that could result in my getting ever more wealthy over time given every residence on Earth should have multiple detectors forever. Thank you! I will not patent this so it’s now in the public domain if it hasn’t already been patented, which is not unlikely given how simple the idea is. I could quickly discover no mention of this idea after performing a Google search for this idea. I wrote about Jeff Clavier last year , and I took the picture of him that accompanies this post. Clavier speaks colorfully. My favorite quote from when I saw him speak August 30, 2012? “I passed on airbnb that some showed me when it was called air bed and breakfast and I said ‘air bed and breakfast… are you f—ing kidding me?” My preference is that the world move quickly towards hard wired sealed detectors that have backup batteries that will last ten years. It also seems that non hard wired detectors should have solar cells like calculators and watches, to keep the batteries from having to drain themselves so quickly. My clock idea I present here is still relevant to such detectors, since I would prefer to learn the detector needs replacing while I am awake and likely to buy a new one at once.

So check out what to consider when shopping for the best carbon monoxide alarms you can obtain for your home, the better to feel safe and sound, and protect your loved ones. How It Works Carbon monoxide detectors are known to be the fastest and most reliable way to thwart CO poisoning. The number of CO detectors you install in your home, office, or other space depends on the size of the area. This device works the same way as a smoke detector by raising alarm when it detects carbon monoxide. There are numerous models of CO detectors on the market today. Some detectors are designed to sound a siren while others are meant to send alerts to smartphones and home security systems. While all carbon monoxide detectors are supposed to sound alarms when they become exposed to a certain level of CO, different sensors sound different types of alerts. For example, biomimetic sensors have a gel that changes color when it takes in a certain amount of carbon monoxide. This change of color is what triggers an alarm. Other detectors utilize metal oxide semiconductors that lower the electrical resistance when they are exposed to CO, thus sounding the alarm. Also, you will come across carbon monoxide detectors that utilize electrochemical sensors. These electrodes sense changes in electrical currents when exposed to a certain amount of carbon monoxide. It is this change in currency that triggers an alarm. It is crucial to note that once the alarm has gone off, the CO detector will only go silent when it is in a carbon monoxide-free environment. In most cases, the CO detector will sound an alarm when it senses a buildup of carbon monoxide. This takes some time, but it is usually before you begin noticing the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning. The higher the level of CO, the faster the alarm goes off. Symptoms of Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Carbon monoxide is dangerous because it enters the blood through the lungs and ties up with red blood cells to starve your body of oxygen. Some of the most common symptoms of CO poisoning include: Headache Vomiting Dizziness Nausea Shortness of breath Fatigue The most troubling thing about these symptoms is the fact that they are completely similar to those associated with cold and flu. Therefore, it is highly easy to ignore them. What’s worse, you are going to experience disorientation and eventually blackout if the level of carbon monoxide reaches 150 parts per million (PPM). If action is not taken immediately, these symptoms will turn lethal. Benefits of Having a Carbon Monoxide Detector If you have a heating system or any other device that uses carbon fuels in your house, you should have a carbon monoxide detector. Therefore, if these systems malfunction, the room shall be filled with the hazardous gas without your knowledge. But with a CO detector, you shall be alerted immediately so that you can take the necessary actions to have it fixed right away. Most CO detectors come with piercing alarms that may be clearly heard throughout the house and wake everyone up if you are sleeping.
